The paradigm, becoming known as reservoir computing, greatly facilitated the practical application of RNNs and outperformed classical fully trained RNNs in many tasks. It has lately become a vivid research field with numerous extensions of the basic idea, including reservoir adaptation, thus broadening the initial paradigm to using different methods for training the reservoir and the readout. This review systematically surveys both current ways of generating/adapting the reservoirs and training different types of readouts. It offers a natural conceptual classification of the techniques, which transcends boundaries of the current “brand-names” of reservoir methods, and thus aims to help in unifying the field and providing the reader with a detailed “map” of it.},

We present the first generic theoretical formulation of the co-adaptive learning problem and give a simple example of two interacting linear learning systems, a human and a machine. Approach. After the description of the training protocol of the two learning systems, we define a simple linear model where the two learning agents are coupled by a joint loss function. The simplicity of the model allows us to find learning rules for both human and machine that permit computing theoretical simulations. Main results. As seen in simulations, an astonishingly rich structure is found for this eco-system of learners. While the co-adaptive learners are shown to easily stall or get out of sync for some parameter settings, we can find a broad sweet spot of parameters where the learning system can converge quickly. It is defined by mid-range learning rates on the side of the learning machine, quite independent of the human in the loop. Despite its simplistic assumptions the theoretical study could be confirmed by a real-world experimental study where human and machine co-adapt to perform cursor control under distortion. Also in this practical setting the mid-range learning rates yield the best performance and behavioral ratings. Significance. The results presented in this mathematical study allow the computation of simple theoretical simulations and performance of real experimental paradigms. Additionally, they are nicely in line with previous results in the BCI literature.},

	abstract = {Although numerous behavioural studies provide evidence that there exist wide differences within individual motor imagery (MI) abilities, little is known with regards to the functional neuroanatomical networks that dissociate someone with good versus poor MI capacities. For the first time, we thus compared, through functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), the pattern of cerebral activations in 13 skilled and 15 unskilled imagers during both physical execution and MI of a sequence of finger movements. Differences in MI abilities were assessed using well-established questionnaire and chronometric measures, as well as a new index based upon the subject's peripheral responses from the autonomic nervous system. As expected, both good and poor imagers activated the inferior and superior parietal lobules, as well as motor-related regions including the lateral and medial premotor cortex, the cerebellum and putamen. Inter-group comparisons revealed that good imagers activated more the parietal and ventrolateral premotor regions, which are known to play a critical role in the generation of mental images. By contrast, poor imagers recruited the cerebellum, orbito-frontal and posterior cingulate cortices. Consistent with findings from the motor sequence learning literature and Doyon and Ungerleider's model of motor learning [Doyon, J., Ungerleider, L.G., 2002. Functional anatomy of motor skill learning. In: Squire, L.R., Schacter, D.L. (Eds.), Neuropsychology of memory, Guilford Press, pp. 225–238], our results demonstrate that compared to skilled imagers, poor imagers not only need to recruit the cortico-striatal system, but to compensate with the cortico-cerebellar system during MI of sequential movements.},

	abstract = {Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal is widely used in brain computer interfaces (BCI), the pattern of which differs significantly across different subjects, and poses a major challenge for real world application of EEG classifiers. We propose an efficient transfer learning method, named Meta UPdate Strategy (MUPS), for the EEG cross subject classification task. The model adopts model agnostic meta learning (MAML) algorithm in the transfer process, and only need a small amount of data to adapt onto target subject. Its mechanism involves two steps: (1) extract versatile features that are effective across all source subjects, and (2) adapt the model to target subject with limited data available. The proposed model, which originates from meta learning, aims to find feature representation that is broadly suitable for different subjects, and maximizes sensitivity of the loss function on new subject such that one or a small number of gradient steps can lead to effective adaptation. The method can be applied to all deep learning oriented models. We performed extensive experiments on two public datasets, the proposed MUPS model outperforms current state of the arts in terms of both accuracy and AUC-ROC when a small amount of target data is used.},

	abstract = {Objective. Brain–computer interfaces (BCI) enable direct communication with a computer, using neural activity as the control signal. This neural signal is generally chosen from a variety of well-studied electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. For a given BCI paradigm, feature extractors and classifiers are tailored to the distinct characteristics of its expected EEG control signal, limiting its application to that specific signal. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which have been used in computer vision and speech recognition to perform automatic feature extraction and classification, have successfully been applied to EEG-based BCIs; however, they have mainly been applied to single BCI paradigms and thus it remains unclear how these architectures generalize to other paradigms. Here, we ask if we can design a single CNN architecture to accurately classify EEG signals from different BCI paradigms, while simultaneously being as compact as possible. Approach. In this work we introduce EEGNet, a compact convolutional neural network for EEG-based BCIs. We introduce the use of depthwise and separable convolutions to construct an EEG-specific model which encapsulates well-known EEG feature extraction concepts for BCI. We compare EEGNet, both for within-subject and cross-subject classification, to current state-of-the-art approaches across four BCI paradigms: P300 visual-evoked potentials, error-related negativity responses (ERN), movement-related cortical potentials (MRCP), and sensory motor rhythms (SMR).},

The method is trained and evaluated on 24 patients , all suffering from focal medically intractable epilepsy, from the Epilepsiae database. The evaluation of the method, conducted using an average of 113 hours (min: 32 h, max: 229 h) of iEEG data per patient, shows that the proposed algorithm improves upon existing methods for seizure detection with iEEG.},

	abstract = {Background
In cognitive neuroscience the potential of deep neural networks (DNNs) for solving complex classification tasks is yet to be fully exploited. The most limiting factor is that DNNs as notorious ‘black boxes’ do not provide insight into neurophysiological phenomena underlying a decision. Layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) has been introduced as a novel method to explain individual network decisions.
New method
We propose the application of DNNs with LRP for the first time for EEG data analysis. Through LRP the single-trial DNN decisions are transformed into heatmaps indicating each data point's relevance for the outcome of the decision.
Results
DNN achieves classification accuracies comparable to those of CSP-LDA. In subjects with low performance subject-to-subject transfer of trained DNNs can improve the results. The single-trial LRP heatmaps reveal neurophysiologically plausible patterns, resembling CSP-derived scalp maps. Critically, while CSP patterns represent class-wise aggregated information, LRP heatmaps pinpoint neural patterns to single time points in single trials.
Comparison with existing method(s)
We compare the classification performance of DNNs to that of linear CSP-LDA on two data sets related to motor-imaginary BCI.
Conclusion
We have demonstrated that DNN is a powerful non-linear tool for EEG analysis. With LRP a new quality of high-resolution assessment of neural activity can be reached. LRP is a potential remedy for the lack of interpretability of DNNs that has limited their utility in neuroscientific applications. The extreme specificity of the LRP-derived heatmaps opens up new avenues for investigating neural activity underlying complex perception or decision-related processes.},

One such application is electroencephalogram (EEG) based brain-computer interface (BCI), where multiple convolutional neural network (CNN) models have been proposed for EEG classification. However, it has been found that deep learning models can be easily fooled with adversarial examples, which are normal examples with small deliberate perturbations. This paper proposes an unsupervised fast gradient sign method (UFGSM) to attack three popular CNN classifiers in BCIs, and demonstrates its effectiveness. We also verify the transferability of adversarial examples in BCIs, which means we can perform attacks even without knowing the architecture and parameters of the target models, or the datasets they were trained on. To our knowledge, this is the first study on the vulnerability of CNN classifiers in EEG-based BCIs, and hopefully will trigger more attention on the security of BCI systems.},

	abstract = {We present a brief history of the field of interpretable machine learning (IML), give an overview of state-of-the-art interpretation methods, and discuss challenges. Research in IML has boomed in recent years. As young as the field is, it has over 200 years old roots in regression modeling and rule-based machine learning, starting in the 1960s. Recently, many new IML methods have been proposed, many of them model-agnostic, but also interpretation techniques specific to deep learning and tree-based ensembles. IML methods either directly analyze model components, study sensitivity to input perturbations, or analyze local or global surrogate approximations of the ML model. The field approaches a state of readiness and stability, with many methods not only proposed in research, but also implemented in open-source software. But many important challenges remain for IML, such as dealing with dependent features, causal interpretation, and uncertainty estimation, which need to be resolved for its successful application to scientific problems. A further challenge is a missing rigorous definition of interpretability, which is accepted by the community. To address the challenges and advance the field, we urge to recall our roots of interpretable, data-driven modeling in statistics and (rule-based) ML, but also to consider other areas such as sensitivity analysis, causal inference, and the social sciences.},

There is increasing interest in using deep ConvNets for end-to-end EEG analysis, but a better understanding of how to design and train ConvNets for end-to-end EEG decoding and how to visualize the informative EEG features the ConvNets learn is still needed. Here, we studied deep ConvNets with a range of different architectures, designed for decoding imagined or executed tasks from raw EEG. Our results show that recent advances from the machine learning field, including batch normalization and exponential linear units, together with a cropped training strategy, boosted the deep ConvNets decoding performance, reaching at least as good performance as the widely used filter bank common spatial patterns (FBCSP) algorithm (mean decoding accuracies 82.1\% FBCSP, 84.0\% deep ConvNets). While FBCSP is designed to use spectral power modulations, the features used by ConvNets are not fixed a priori. Our novel methods for visualizing the learned features demonstrated that ConvNets indeed learned to use spectral power modulations in the alpha, beta, and high gamma frequencies, and proved useful for spatially mapping the learned features by revealing the topography of the causal contributions of features in different frequency bands to the decoding decision. Our study thus shows how to design and train ConvNets to decode task-related information from the raw EEG without handcrafted features and highlights the potential of deep ConvNets combined with advanced visualization techniques for EEG-based brain mapping.

	abstract = {Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have become a powerful technique to decode EEG and have become the benchmark for motor imagery EEG Brain-Computer-Interface (BCI) decoding. However, it is still challenging to train CNNs on multiple subjects' EEG without decreasing individual performance. This is known as the negative transfer problem, i.e. learning from dissimilar distributions causes CNNs to misrepresent each of them instead of learning a richer representation. As a result, CNNs cannot directly use multiple subjects' EEG to enhance model performance directly. To address this problem, we extend deep transfer learning techniques to the EEG multi-subject training case. We propose a multi-branch deep transfer network, the Separate-Common-Separate Network (SCSN) based on splitting the network's feature extractors for individual subjects. We also explore the possibility of applying Maximum-mean discrepancy (MMD) to the SCSN (SCSN-MMD) to better align distributions of features from individual feature extractors. The proposed network is evaluated on the BCI Competition IV 2a dataset (BCICIV2a dataset) and our online recorded dataset. Results show that the proposed SCSN (81.8\%, 53.2\%) and SCSN-MMD (81.8\%, 54.8\%) outperformed the benchmark CNN (73.4\%, 48.8\%) on both datasets using multiple subjects. Our proposed networks show the potential to utilise larger multi-subject datasets to train an EEG decoder without being influenced by negative transfer.},

This paper proposes a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture for accurate and robust EEG-based MI classification that outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. The proposed CNN model, namely EEG-Inception, is built on the backbone of the Inception-Time network, which showed to be highly efficient and accurate for time-series classification. Also, the proposed network is an end-to-end classification, as it takes the raw EEG signals as the input and does not require complex EEG signal-preprocessing. Furthermore, this paper proposes a novel data augmentation method for EEG signals to enhance the accuracy, at least by 3\%, and reduce overfitting with limited BCI datasets. The proposed model outperforms all the state-of-the-art methods by achieving the average accuracy of 88.4\% and 88.6\% on the 2008 BCI Competition IV 2a (four-classes) and 2b datasets (binary-classes), respectively. Furthermore, it takes less than 0.025 seconds to test a sample suitable for real-time processing. Moreover, the classification standard deviation for nine different subjects achieves the lowest value of 5.5 for the 2b dataset and 7.1 for the 2a dataset, which validates that the proposed method is highly robust. From the experiment results, it can be inferred that the EEG-Inception network exhibits a strong potential as a subject-independent classifier for EEG-based MI tasks.},

	abstract = {Brain-Machine Interfaces (BMIs) have recently emerged as a clinically viable option to restore voluntary movements after paralysis. These devices are based on the ability to extract information about movement intent from neural signals recorded using multi-electrode arrays chronically implanted in the motor cortices of the brain. However, the inherent loss and turnover of recorded neurons requires repeated recalibrations of the interface, which can potentially alter the day-to-day user experience. The resulting need for continued user adaptation interferes with the natural, subconscious use of the BMI. Here, we introduce a new computational approach that decodes movement intent from a low-dimensional latent representation of the neural data. We implement various domain adaptation methods to stabilize the interface over significantly long times. This includes Canonical Correlation Analysis used to align the latent variables across days; this method requires prior point-to-point correspondence of the time series across domains. Alternatively, we match the empirical probability distributions of the latent variables across days through the minimization of their Kullback-Leibler divergence. These two methods provide a significant and comparable improvement in the performance of the interface. However, implementation of an Adversarial Domain Adaptation Network trained to match the empirical probability distribution of the residuals of the reconstructed neural signals outperforms the two methods based on latent variables, while requiring remarkably few data points to solve the domain adaptation problem.},

Approach. Our coadaptive framework combines the BrainTree speller with smooth-batch linear discriminant analysis adaptation. The latter enjoys contextual assistance through BrainTree’s language model to improve online expectation-maximization maximum-likelihood estimation. Main results. Our results verify the possibility to restore single-sample classiﬁcation and BCI command accuracy, as well as spelling speed for expert users. Most importantly, context-aware adaptation performs signiﬁcantly better than its unsupervised equivalent and similar to the supervised one. Although no signiﬁcant differences are found with respect to the state-of-the-art PMean approach, the proposed algorithm is shown to be advantageous for 30\% of the users. Signiﬁcance. We demonstrate the possibility to circumvent supervised BCI recalibration, saving time without compromising the adaptation quality.

	abstract = {Electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive method for the analysis of neurological disorders. Epilepsy is one of the most widespread neurological disorders and often characterized by repeated seizures. This paper intends to conduct an iterative filtering based decomposition of EEG signals to improve upon the accuracy of seizure detection. The proposed approach is evaluated using All India Institute of Medical Science (AIIMS) Patna EEG database and online CHB-MIT surface EEG database. The iterative filtering decomposition technique is applied to extract sub-components from the EEG signal. The feature set obtained from each segmented intrinsic mode function consists of 2-D power spectral density and time-domain features dynamic mode decomposition power, variance, and Katz fractal dimension. The Hidden Markov Model (HMM) based probabilistic model has been designed using the above-stated features representing the seizure and non-seizure EEG events. The EEG signal is classified based on the maximum score obtained from the individual feature-based classifiers. The maximum score derived from each HMM classifier gives the final class information. The proposed decomposition of EEG signals achieved 99.60\% and 99.74\% accuracy in seizure detection for the online CHB-MIT surface EEG database and AIIMS Patna EEG database, respectively.},

The model comprises hidden layers of state-space or dynamic causal models, arranged so that the output of one provides input to another. The ensuing hierarchy furnishes a model for many types of data, of arbitrary complexity. Special cases range from the general linear model for static data to generalised convolution models, with system noise, for nonlinear time-series analysis. Crucially, all of these models can be inverted using exactly the same scheme, namely, dynamic expectation maximization. This means that a single model and optimisation scheme can be used to invert a wide range of models. We present the model and a brief review of its inversion to disclose the relationships among, apparently, diverse generative models of empirical data. We then show that this inversion can be formulated as a simple neural network and may provide a useful metaphor for inference and learning in the brain.},

	abstract = {Epilepsy is a unique neurologic condition characterized by recurrent seizures, where causes, underlying biomarkers, triggers, and patterns differ across individuals. The unpredictability of seizures can heighten fear and anxiety in people with epilepsy, making it difficult to take part in day-to-day activities. Epilepsy researchers have prioritized developing seizure prediction algorithms to combat episodic seizures for decades, but the utility and effectiveness of prediction algorithms has not been investigated thoroughly in clinical settings. In contrast, seizure forecasts, which theoretically provide the probability of a seizure at any time (as opposed to predicting the next seizure occurrence), may be more feasible. Many advances have been made over the past decade in the field of seizure forecasting, including improvements in algorithms as a result of machine learning and exploration of non–EEG-based measures of seizure susceptibility, such as physiological biomarkers, behavioral changes, environmental drivers, and cyclic seizure patterns. For example, recent work investigating periodicities in individual seizure patterns has determined that more than 90\% of people have circadian rhythms in their seizures, and many also experience multiday, weekly, or longer cycles. Other potential indicators of seizure susceptibility include stress levels, heart rate, and sleep quality, all of which have the potential to be captured noninvasively over long time scales. There are many possible applications of a seizure-forecasting device, including improving quality of life for people with epilepsy, guiding treatment plans and medication titration, optimizing presurgical monitoring, and focusing scientific research. To realize this potential, it is vital to better understand the user requirements of a seizure-forecasting device, continue to advance forecasting algorithms, and design clear guidelines for prospective clinical trials of seizure forecasting.},

	abstract = {Purpose: How long after starting a new medication must a patient go without seizures before they can be regarded as seizure-free? A recent International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) task force proposed using a “Rule of Three” as an operational definition of seizure freedom, according to which a patient should be considered seizure-free following an intervention after a period without seizures has elapsed equal to three times the longest preintervention interseizure interval over the previous year. This rule was motivated in large part by statistical considerations advanced in a classic 1983 paper by Hanley and Lippman-Hand. However, strict adherence to the statistical logic of this rule generally requires waiting much longer than recommended by the ILAE task force. Therefore, we set out to determine whether an alternative approach to the Rule of Three might be possible, and under what conditions the rule may be expected to hold or would need to be extended. Methods: Probabilistic modeling and application of Bayes’ rule. Key Findings: We find that an alternative approach to the problem of inferring seizure freedom supports using the Rule of Three in the way proposed by the ILAE in many cases, particularly in evaluating responses to a first trial of antiseizure medication, and to favorably-selected epilepsy surgical candidates. In cases where the a priori odds of success are less favorable, our analysis requires longer seizure-free observation periods before declaring seizure freedom, up to six times the average preintervention interseizure interval. The key to our approach is to take into account not only the time elapsed without seizures but also empirical data regarding the a priori probability of achieving seizure freedom conferred by a particular intervention. Significance: In many cases it may be reasonable to consider a patient seizure-free after they have gone without seizures for a period equal to three times the preintervention interseizure interval, as proposed on pragmatic grounds in a recent ILAE position paper, although in other commonly encountered cases a waiting time up to six times this interval is required. In this work we have provided a coherent theoretical basis for modified criterion for seizure freedom, which we call the “Rule of Three-To-Six.”},

They suggest innovative treatment strategies, such as minimally invasive ablations or stimulations that fully exploit the network and dynamical properties of the system, or even modulation of variables and parameters to force the system in safer regions of the bifurcation diagram.

	abstract = {Seizures can occur spontaneously and in a recurrent manner, which defines epilepsy; or they can be induced in a normal brain under a variety of conditions in most neuronal networks and species from flies to humans. Such universality raises the possibility that invariant properties exist that characterize seizures under different physiological and pathological conditions. Here, we analysed seizure dynamics mathematically and established a taxonomy of seizures based on first principles. For the predominant seizure class we developed a generic model called Epileptor. As an experimental model system, we used ictal-like discharges induced in vitro in mouse hippocampi. We show that only five state variables linked by integral-differential equations are sufficient to describe the onset, time course and offset of ictal-like discharges as well as their recurrence. Two state variables are responsible for generating rapid discharges (fast time scale), two for spike and wave events (intermediate time scale) and one for the control of time course, including the alternation between 'normal' and ictal periods (slow time scale). We propose that normal and ictal activities coexist: a separatrix acts as a barrier (or seizure threshold) between these states. Seizure onset is reached upon the collision of normal brain trajectories with the separatrix. We show theoretically and experimentally how a system can be pushed toward seizure under a wide variety of conditions. Within our experimental model, the onset and offset of ictal-like discharges are well-defined mathematical events: a saddle-node and homoclinic bifurcation, respectively. These bifurcations necessitate a baseline shift at onset and a logarithmic scaling of interspike intervals at offset. These predictions were not only confirmed in our in vitro experiments, but also for focal seizures recorded in different syndromes, brain regions and species (humans and zebrafish). Finally, we identified several possible biophysical parameters contributing to the five state variables in our model system. We show that these parameters apply to specific experimental conditions and propose that there exists a wide array of possible biophysical mechanisms for seizure genesis, while preserving central invariant properties. Epileptor and the seizure taxonomy will guide future modeling and translational research by identifying universal rules governing the initiation and termination of seizures and predicting the conditions necessary for those transitions.},

	abstract = {There are deep and important philosophical diﬀerences between Bayesian and frequentist approaches to quantifying uncertainty. However, some practitioners choose between these approaches primarily on the basis of convenience. For instance, the ability to incorporate parameter constraints is sometimes cited as a reason to use Bayesian methods. This reﬂects two misunderstandings: First, frequentist methods can indeed incorporate constraints on parameter values. Second, it ignores the crucial question of what the result of the analysis will mean. Bayesian and frequentist measures of uncertainty have similar sounding names but quite diﬀerent meanings. For instance, Bayesian uncertainties typically involve expectations with respect to the posterior distribution of the parameter, holding the data ﬁxed; frequentist uncertainties typically involve expectations with respect to the distribution of the data, holding the parameter ﬁxed. Bayesian methods, including methods incorporating parameter constraints, require supplementing the constraints with a prior probability distribution for parameter values. This can cause frequentist and Bayesian estimates and their nominal uncertainties to diﬀer substantially, even when the prior is “uninformative.” This paper gives simple examples where “uninformative” priors are, in fact, extremely informative, and sketches how to measure how much information the prior adds to the constraint. Bayesian methods can have good frequentist behavior, and a frequentist can use Bayesian methods and quantify the uncertainty by frequentist means—but absent a meaningful prior, Bayesian uncertainty measures lack meaning. The paper ends with brief reﬂections on practice.},

In this study, we provide a comparison of various traditional classification algorithms to the newer methods of deep learning. We explore two different types of deep learning methods, namely, convolutional neural networks (CNN) and recurrent neural networks (RNN) with long short-term memory (LSTM) architecture. We test the classification accuracies on a recent 5-dass steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) dataset. The results prove the superiority of deep learning methods in comparison with the traditional classification algorithms. Amongst the traditional classifiers, support vector machine (SVM) with Gaussian kernel employing sequential forward selection (SFS) of features provided a better classification accuracy of 66.09\%, while CNN provided the highest classification accuracy of 69.03\%.},

	abstract = {While Deep Learning (DL) is often considered the state-of-the art for Artificial Intel-ligence-based medical decision support, it remains sparsely implemented in clinical practice and poorly trusted by clinicians due to insufficient interpretability of neural network models. We have approached this issue in the context of online detection of epileptic seizures by developing a DL model from EEG signals, and associating certain properties of the model behavior with the expert medical knowledge. This has conditioned the preparation of the input signals, the network architecture, and the post-processing of the output in line with the domain knowledge. Specifically, we focused the discussion on three main aspects: (1) how to aggregate the classification results on signal segments provided by the DL model into a larger time scale, at the seizure-level; (2) what are the relevant frequency patterns learned in the first convolutional layer of different models, and their relation with the delta, theta, alpha, beta and gamma frequency bands on which the visual interpretation of EEG is based; and (3) the identification of the signal waveforms with larger contribution towards the ictal class, according to the activation differences highlighted using the DeepLIFT method. Results show that the kernel size in the first layer determines the interpretability of the extracted features and the sensitivity of the trained models, even though the final performance is very similar after post-processing. Also, we found that amplitude is the main feature leading to an ictal prediction, suggesting that a larger patient population would be required to learn more complex frequency patterns. Still, our methodology was successfully able to generalize patient inter-variability for the majority of the studied population with a classification F1-score of 0.873 and detecting 90\% of the seizures.},

For simplicity we restrict our attention to one-dimensional variables and use logarithm and exponential notations log and exp without specifying the base.

Here we present a subset of the papers that were offered in response to a request for the “most amazing papers in neuroscience” that appeared on the listserv of the Faculty for Undergraduate Neuroscience (FUN). Each contributor was subsequently asked to describe briefly the content of their recommended papers, their pedagogical value, and the audiences for which these papers are best suited.

It is not our intention that any article within this collection will provide the final word on an area of investigation, nor that this collection will provide the final word for the discipline as a whole. Rather, this article is a collection of papers that have proven themselves valuable in the hands of these particular educators.

	abstract = {Epilepsy is a dynamic disease in which the brain transitions between different states. In this paper, we focus on the problem of identifying the time points, referred to as change points, where the transitions between these different states happen. A Bayesian change point detection algorithm that does not require the knowledge of the total number of states or the parameters of the probability distribution modeling the activity of epileptic brain in each of these states is developed in this paper. This algorithm works in online mode making it amenable for real-time monitoring. To reduce the quadratic complexity of this algorithm, an approximate algorithm with linear complexity in the number of data points is also developed. Finally, we use these algorithms on ECoG recordings of an epileptic patient to locate the change points and determine segments corresponding to different brain states.},

Unlike other existing methods whose applicability is limited, our framework is global, and it has only weak constraints over the inputs. Moreover, the Koopman operator is linear, and it is related to a rich mathematical theory. Thus, we can use tools and insights from linear analysis and Koopman Theory in our study. For instance, we show that the operator eigendecomposition is instrumental in exploring the dominant features of the network.

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.08336},
	abstract = {Automated seizure detection and classification from electroencephalography (EEG) can greatly improve the diagnosis and treatment of seizures. While prior studies mainly used convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that assume image-like structure in EEG signals or spectrograms, this modeling choice does not reflect the natural geometry of or connectivity between EEG electrodes. In this study, we propose modeling EEGs as graphs and present a graph neural network for automated seizure detection and classification. In addition, we leverage unlabeled EEG data using a self-supervised pre-training strategy. Our graph model with self-supervised pre-training significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art CNN and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models by 6.3 points (7.8\%) in Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC) for seizure detection and 6.3 points (9.2\%) in weighted F1-score for seizure type classification. Ablation studies show that our graph-based modeling approach significantly outperforms existing CNN or LSTM models, and that self-supervision helps further improve the model performance. Moreover, we find that self-supervised pre-training substantially improves model performance on combined tonic seizures, a low-prevalence seizure type. Furthermore, our model interpretability analysis suggests that our model is better at identifying seizure regions compared to an existing CNN. In summary, our graph-based modeling approach integrates domain knowledge about EEG, sets a new state-of-the-art for seizure detection and classification on a large public dataset (5,499 EEG files), and provides better ability to identify seizure regions.},

	abstract = {Because of increased awareness of the high prevalence of nonconvulsive seizures in critically ill patients, use of continuous EEG (cEEG) monitoring is rapidly increasing in ICUs. However, cEEG monitoring is labor intensive, and manual review and interpretation of the EEG are impractical in most ICUs. Effective methods to assist in rapid and accurate detection of nonconvulsive seizures would greatly reduce the cost of cEEG monitoring and enhance the quality of patient care. In this study, we report a preliminary investigation of a novel ICU EEG analysis and seizure detection algorithm. Twenty-four prolonged cEEG recordings were included in this study. Seizure detection sensitivity and specificity were assessed for the new algorithm and for the two commercial seizure detection software systems. The new algorithm performed with a mean sensitivity of 90.4\% and a mean false detection rate of 0.066/hour. The two commercial detection products performed with low sensitivities (12.9 and 10.1\%) and false detection rates of 1.036/hour and 0.013/hour, respectively. These findings suggest that the novel algorithm has potential to be the basis of clinically useful software that can assist ICU staff in timely identification of nonconvulsive seizures. This study also suggests that currently available seizure detection software does not perform sufficiently in detection of nonconvulsive seizures in critically ill patients.

It has become critical to explore how machine learning and specifically deep learning methods can be exploited to analyse healthcare data. A major limitation of existing methods has been the focus on grid-like data; however, the structure of physiological recordings are often irregular and unordered which makes it difficult to conceptualise them as a matrix. As such, graph neural networks have attracted significant attention by exploiting implicit information that resides in a biological system, with interactive nodes connected by edges whose weights can be either temporal associations or anatomical junctions. In this survey, we thoroughly review the different types of graph architectures and their applications in healthcare. We provide an overview of these methods in a systematic manner, organized by their domain of application including functional connectivity, anatomical structure and electrical-based analysis. We also outline the limitations of existing techniques and discuss potential directions for future research.},

The most important reason for this is that in conventional methods, increasing classification accuracy is based on too many human efforts as EEG is being processed, obtaining the features is the most important step. This stage is based on both the time-consuming and the investigation of many feature methods. Therefore, there is a need for methods that do not require human effort in this area and can learn the features themselves. Based on that, two-dimensional (2D) frequency-time scalograms were obtained in this study by applying Continuous Wavelet Transform to EEG records containing five different classes. Convolutional Neural Network structure was used to learn the properties of these scalogram images and the classification performance of the structure was compared with the studies in the literature. In order to compare the performance of the proposed method, the data set of the University of Bonn was used. The data set consists of five EEG records containing healthy and epilepsy disease which are labeled as A, B, C, D, and E. In the study, A-E and B-E data sets were classified as 99.50\%, A-D and B-D data sets were classified as 100\% in binary classifications, A-D-E data sets were 99.00\% in triple classification, A-C-D-E data sets were 90.50\%, B-C-D-E data sets were 91.50\% in quaternary classification, and A-B-C-D-E data sets were in the fifth class classification with an accuracy of 93.60\%.},

	abstract = {Epilepsy is a common disorder characterized by recurrent seizures. An overwhelming majority of people with epilepsy regard the unpredictability of seizures as a major issue. More than 30 years of international effort have been devoted to the prediction of seizures, aiming to remove the burden of unpredictability and to couple novel, time-specific treatment to seizure prediction technology. A highly influential review published in 2007 concluded that insufficient evidence indicated that seizures could be predicted. Since then, several advances have been made, including successful prospective seizure prediction using intracranial EEG in a small number of people in a trial of a real-time seizure prediction device. In this Review, we examine advances in the field, including EEG databases, seizure prediction competitions, the prospective trial mentioned and advances in our understanding of the mechanisms of seizures. We argue that these advances, together with statistical evaluations, set the stage for a resurgence in efforts towards the development of seizure prediction methodologies. We propose new avenues of investigation involving a synergy between mechanisms, models, data, devices and algorithms and refine the existing guidelines for the development of seizure prediction technology to instigate development of a solution that removes the burden of the unpredictability of seizures.},

Although major achievements were accomplished regarding the statistical evaluation of proposed algorithms, it is recognized that further progress is still necessary for clinical application in patients.

Here we review the literature on the multiple-scale neural modelling of epilepsy and the use of such models to infer physiological changes underlying epilepsy and epileptic seizures. We argue how these methods can be applied to advance the state-of-the-art in seizure forecasting.},

	abstract = {Epilepsy is among the most dynamic disorders in neurology. A canonical view holds that seizures, the characteristic sign of epilepsy, occur at random, but, for centuries, humans have looked for patterns of temporal organization in seizure occurrence. Observations that seizures are cyclical date back to antiquity, but recent technological advances have, for the first time, enabled cycles of seizure occurrence to be quantitatively characterized with direct brain recordings. Chronic recordings of brain activity in humans and in animals have yielded converging evidence for the existence of cycles of epileptic brain activity that operate over diverse timescales: daily (circadian), multi-day (multidien) and yearly (circannual). Here, we review this evidence, synthesizing data from historical observational studies, modern implanted devices, electronic seizure diaries and laboratory-based animal neurophysiology. We discuss advances in our understanding of the mechanistic underpinnings of these cycles and highlight the knowledge gaps that remain. The potential clinical applications of a knowledge of cycles in epilepsy, including seizure forecasting and chronotherapy, are discussed in the context of the emerging concept of seizure risk. In essence, this Review addresses the broad question of why seizures occur when they occur.},

In contrast, power-law behaviors associated with seizures, in the form of epileptic quakes, potentially interfere with the brain’s computational activities. This review draws attention to the potential roles played by homeostatic mechanisms and multistable time-delayed recurrent inhibitory loops in the generation of power-law phenomena. Moreover, it is suggested that distinctions between health and disease are scale-dependent. In other words, what is abnormal and defines disease it is not the propagation of neural activity but the propagation of activity in a neural population that is large enough to interfere with the normal activities of the brain. From this point of view, epilepsy is a disease that results from a failure of mechanisms, possibly located in part in the cortex itself or in the deep brain nuclei and brainstem, which truncate or otherwise confine the spatiotemporal scales of these power-law phenomena.},

It follows that little can be stated about performance on future data, beyond perhaps a simple error count on a given test set. In this article, we argue that the knowledge imparted by deterministic computational methods is not rigorously related to the real world and, in particular, future events.

I will meet this challenge by dealing with the future and then turning to its history. The future of the Bayesian brain (in neuroimaging) is clear: it is the application of dynamic causal modeling to understand how the brain conforms to the free energy principle. In this context, the Bayesian brain is a corollary of the free energy principle, which says that any self organizing system (like a brain or neuroimaging community) must maximize the evidence for its own existence, which means it must minimize its free energy using a model of its world. Dynamic causal modeling involves ﬁnding models of the brain that have the greatest evidence or the lowest free energy. In short, the future of imaging neuroscience is to reﬁne models of the brain to minimize free energy, where the brain reﬁnes models of the world to minimize free energy. This endeavor itself minimizes free energy because our community is itself a self organizing system. I cannot imagine an alternative future that has the same beautiful self consistency as mine. Having dispensed with the future, we can now focus on the past, which is much more interesting: © 2011 Elsevier Inc. Open access under CC BY license.},

The results indicate the existence of sensory- and motor-specific information in the spatial dimension of EEG activity and call for new physiological metaphors and techniques of analysis. Special emphasis is placed in our model on chaotic neural activity. We hypothesize that chaotic behavior serves as the essential ground state for the neural perceptual apparatus, and we propose a mechanism for acquiring new forms of patterned activity corresponding to new learned odors. Finally, some of the implications of our neural model for behavioral theories are briefly discussed.

Given the partially successful existing treatments for epileptiform activity suppression, dynamic mathematical models have been proposed with the purpose of better understanding the factors that might trigger an epileptic seizure and how to mitigate it, among which Epileptor stands out, due to its relative simplicity and high prediction ability. Recent studies using such a model have provided evidence that establishing a feedback-based control approach is possible. However, for this strategy to work properly, Epileptor’s parameters, which describe the dynamic characteristics of a seizure, must be known beforehand. Therefore, this work proposes a methodology for estimating such parameters based on a successive optimization technique. The results show that it is feasible to approximate their values, and integrating this system identiﬁcation approach with observers and controllers can be carried out, which might provide an interesting alternative for seizure suppression in practice in the future.},

Manual annotation of epileptic seizures is a time consuming process performed by expert neurologists. Hence, a procedure which automatically detects seizures would be hugely beneficial for a fast and cost-effective diagnosis. Recent progress in machine learning techniques, especially deep learning methods, coupled with the availability of large public EEG seizure databases provide new opportunities towards the design of automatic EEG-based seizure detection algorithms. We propose an epileptic seizure detection pipeline based on the fusion of multiple attention-gated U-nets, each operating on a different view of the EEG data. These different views correspond to distinct signal processing techniques applied on the raw EEG. The proposed model uses a long short term memory (LSTM) network for fusion of the individual attention-gated U-net outputs to detect seizures in EEG. The model outperforms the state-of-the-art models on the TUH EEG seizure dataset and was awarded the first place in the Neureka™ 2020 Epilepsy Challenge.},

The proposed AG models are evaluated on a variety of tasks, including medical image classification and segmentation. For classification, we demonstrate the use case of AGs in scan plane detection for fetal ultrasound screening. We show that the proposed attention mechanism can provide efficient object localisation while improving the overall prediction performance by reducing false positives. For segmentation, the proposed architecture is evaluated on two large 3D CT abdominal datasets with manual annotations for multiple organs. Experimental results show that AG models consistently improve the prediction performance of the base architectures across different datasets and training sizes while preserving computational efficiency. Moreover, AGs guide the model activations to be focused around salient regions, which provides better insights into how model predictions are made. The source code for the proposed AG models is publicly available.},

	abstract = {In this chapter we discuss a comprehensive framework for decomposing nonstationary time-series into a set of constituent processes. Our methodology is based on autoregressive moving-average (ARMA) modeling and on state-space modeling. For the purpose of modeling nonstationary phenomena, such as sudden phase transitions in dynamical behavior, we employ “generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedastic modeling” (GARCH modeling), a technique originally introduced in the field of financial data analysis; however, this technique first needs to be generalized to the case of state-space modeling. Models are obtained through maximum-likelihood estimation; the innovation approach to time-series prediction helps us to derive an approximative expression for the likelihood of given data. We present three application examples relevant to the analysis of nonstationary phenomena in EEG time-series; the first case is the transition from the conscious state into anesthesia in a human patient, the second is the transition into epileptic seizure in a human patient, and the third is the transition between two sleep stages in a sheep fetus. The modeling algorithm does not require any prior information on the timing of such nonstationary phenomena.},

	abstract = {In time series analysis (or forecasting) — as conducted in statistics, signal processing, and many other fields — the innovation is the difference between the observed value of a variable at time t and the optimal forecast of that value based on information available prior to time t.  If the forecasting method is working correctly, successive innovations are uncorrelated with each other, i.e., constitute a white noise time series.  Thus it can be said that the innovation time series is obtained from the measurement time series by a process of 'whitening', or removing the predictable component. The use of the term innovation in the sense described here is due to Hendrik Bode and Claude Shannon (1950) in their discussion of the Wiener filter problem, although the notion was already implicit in the work of Kolmogorov.In contrast, the residual is the difference between the observed value of a variable at time t and the optimal updated state of that value based on information available till (including) time t.},

	abstract = {The rapid recent progress in machine learning (ML) has raised a number of scientific questions that challenge the longstanding dogma of the field. One of the most important riddles is the good empirical generalization of overparameterized models. Overparameterized models are excessively complex with respect to the size of the training dataset, which results in them perfectly fitting (i.e., interpolating) the training data, which is usually noisy. Such interpolation of noisy data is traditionally associated with detrimental overfitting, and yet a wide range of interpolating models -- from simple linear models to deep neural networks -- have recently been observed to generalize extremely well on fresh test data. Indeed, the recently discovered double descent phenomenon has revealed that highly overparameterized models often improve over the best underparameterized model in test performance. Understanding learning in this overparameterized regime requires new theory and foundational empirical studies, even for the simplest case of the linear model. The underpinnings of this understanding have been laid in very recent analyses of overparameterized linear regression and related statistical learning tasks, which resulted in precise analytic characterizations of double descent. This paper provides a succinct overview of this emerging theory of overparameterized ML (henceforth abbreviated as TOPML) that explains these recent findings through a statistical signal processing perspective. We emphasize the unique aspects that define the TOPML research area as a subfield of modern ML theory and outline interesting open questions that remain.},

The limitations of existing hospital- and home-based monitoring solutions are motivating the development of minimally invasive, subscalp, implantable electroencephalography (EEG) systems with accompanying cloud-based software. This new generation of ultra–long-term brain monitoring systems is setting expectations for a sea change in the field of clinical epilepsy. From definitive diagnoses and reliable seizure logs to treatment optimization and presurgical seizure foci localization, the clinical need for continuous monitoring of brain electrophysiological activity in epilepsy patients is evident. This paper presents the converging solutions developed independently by researchers and organizations working at the forefront of next generation EEG monitoring. The immediate value of these devices is discussed as well as the potential drivers and hurdles to adoption. Additionally, this paper discusses what the expected value of ultra–long-term EEG data might be in the future with respect to alarms for especially focal seizures, seizure forecasting, and treatment personalization.},

	abstract = {Electrophysiological mass potentials show complex spectral changes upon neuronal activation. However, it is unknown to what extent these complex band-limited changes are interrelated or, alternatively, reflect separate neuronal processes. To address this question, intracranial electrocorticograms (ECoG) responses were recorded in patients engaged in visuomotor tasks. We found that in the 10- to 100-Hz frequency range there was a significant reduction in the exponent χ of the 1/ f
              χ
              component of the spectrum associated with neuronal activation. In a minority of electrodes showing particularly high activations the exponent reduction was associated with specific band-limited power modulations: emergence of a high gamma (80–100 Hz) and a decrease in the alpha (9–12 Hz) peaks. Importantly, the peaks' height was correlated with the 1/ f
              χ
              exponent on activation. Control simulation ruled out the possibility that the change in 1/ f
              χ
              exponent was a consequence of the analysis procedure. These results reveal a new global, cross-frequency (10–100 Hz) neuronal process reflected in a significant reduction of the power spectrum slope of the ECoG signal.},

We compute the probability distribution of the length of the current ``run,'' or time since the last changepoint, using a simple message-passing algorithm.

	abstract = {The majority of seizures recorded in humans and experimental animal models can be described by a generic phenomenological mathematical model, The Epileptor. In this model, seizure-like events (SLEs) are driven by a slow variable and occur via saddle node (SN) and homoclinic bifurcations at seizure onset and offset, respectively. Here we investigated SLEs at the single cell level using a biophysically relevant neuron model including a slow/fast system of four equations. The two equations for the slow subsystem describe ion concentration variations and the two equations of the fast subsystem delineate the electrophysiological activities of the neuron. Using extracellular K+ as a slow variable, we report that SLEs with SN/homoclinic bifurcations can readily occur at the single cell level when extracellular K+ reaches a critical value. In patients and experimental models, seizures can also evolve into sustained ictal activity (SIA) and, depolarization block (DB), activities which are also parts of the dynamic repertoire of the Epileptor. Increasing extracellular concentration of K+ in the model to values found during experimental status epilepticus and DB, we show that SIA and DB can also occur at the single cell level. Thus, seizures, SIA and DB, which have been first identified as network events, can exist in a unified framework of a biophysical model at the single neuron level and exhibit similar dynamics as observed in the Epileptor.
Author Summary Epilepsy is a neurological disorder characterized by the occurrence of seizures. Seizures have been characterized in patients in experimental models at both macroscopic and microscopic scales using electrophysiological recordings. Experimental works allowed the establishment of a detailed taxonomy of seizures, which can be described by mathematical models. We can distinguish two main types of models. Phenomenological (generic) models have few parameters and variables and permit detailed dynamical studies often capturing a majority of activities observed in experimental conditions. But they also have abstract parameters, making biological interpretation difficult. Biophysical models, on the other hand, use a large number of variables and parameters due to the complexity of the biological systems they represent. Because of the multiplicity of solutions, it is difficult to extract general dynamical rules. In the present work, we integrate both approaches and reduce a detailed biophysical model to sufficiently low-dimensional equations, and thus maintaining the advantages of a generic model. We propose, at the single cell level, a unified framework of different pathological activities that are seizures, depolarization block, and sustained ictal activity.},

            The majority of seizures recorded in humans and experimental animal models can be described by a generic phenomenological mathematical model, The Epileptor. In this model, seizure-like events (SLEs) are driven by a slow variable and occur via saddle node (SN) and homoclinic bifurcations at seizure onset and offset, respectively. Here we investigated SLEs at the single cell level using a biophysically relevant neuron model including a slow/fast system of four equations. The two equations for the slow subsystem describe ion concentration variations and the two equations of the fast subsystem delineate the electrophysiological activities of the neuron. Using extracellular K
            +
            as a slow variable, we report that SLEs with SN/homoclinic bifurcations can readily occur at the single cell level when extracellular K
            +
            reaches a critical value. In patients and experimental models, seizures can also evolve into sustained ictal activity (SIA) and, depolarization block (DB), activities which are also parts of the dynamic repertoire of the Epileptor. Increasing extracellular concentration of K
            +
            in the model to values found during experimental status epilepticus and DB, we show that SIA and DB can also occur at the single cell level. Thus, seizures, SIA and DB, which have been first identified as network events, can exist in a unified framework of a biophysical model at the single neuron level and exhibit similar dynamics as observed in the Epileptor.
          
          
            Author Summary
            Epilepsy is a neurological disorder characterized by the occurrence of seizures. Seizures have been characterized in patients in experimental models at both macroscopic and microscopic scales using electrophysiological recordings. Experimental works allowed the establishment of a detailed taxonomy of seizures, which can be described by mathematical models. We can distinguish two main types of models. Phenomenological (generic) models have few parameters and variables and permit detailed dynamical studies often capturing a majority of activities observed in experimental conditions. But they also have abstract parameters, making biological interpretation difficult. Biophysical models, on the other hand, use a large number of variables and parameters due to the complexity of the biological systems they represent. Because of the multiplicity of solutions, it is difficult to extract general dynamical rules. In the present work, we integrate both approaches and reduce a detailed biophysical model to sufficiently low-dimensional equations, and thus maintaining the advantages of a generic model. We propose, at the single cell level, a unified framework of different pathological activities that are seizures, depolarization block, and sustained ictal activity.},

In line with the statistical tradition, uncertainty has long been perceived as almost synonymous with standard probability and probabilistic predictions. Yet, due to the steadily increasing relevance of machine learning for practical applications and related issues such as safety requirements, new problems and challenges have recently been identified by machine learning scholars, and these problems may call for new methodological developments. In particular, this includes the importance of distinguishing between (at least) two different types of uncertainty, often referred to as aleatoric and epistemic. In this paper, we provide an introduction to the topic of uncertainty in machine learning as well as an overview of attempts so far at handling uncertainty in general and formalizing this distinction in particular.},

	abstract = {Absence epilepsy can result from the disturbance of mechanisms of synaptic transmission. In particular, disturbing inhibitory interactions have been found to be extremely effective for generating seizures, sometimes with contrasting effects. In thalamus and cortex, inhibitory transmission essentially uses γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) as transmitter and operates through two main receptor types, called GABAA and GABAB. These two receptors mediate fast and slow inhibition, respectively. Both types of receptor are of primary importance in seizure mechanisms. This chapter reviews the mechanisms that generate seizures and computational models that simulate these mechanisms. It considers successively the different ingredients of absence seizures: thalamic circuits can generate hypersynchronized oscillations at ∼3 Hz, cortical circuits can generate spike-and-wave patterns and thalamocortical circuits can display generalized spike-and-wave seizures under certain conditions. In particular, it demonstrates that a key ingredient in seizure generation is the feedback connections from cortex to thalamus. Finally, it reviews review critical experiments that successfully tested this corticothalamic feedback mechanism for absence seizure generation.},

        Over the past three decades, a number of seizure prediction, or forecasting, methods have been developed. Although major achievements were accomplished regarding the statistical evaluation of proposed algorithms, it is recognized that further progress is still necessary for clinical application in patients. The lack of physiological motivation can partly explain this limitation. Therefore, a natural question is raised: can computational models of epilepsy be used to improve these methods? Here, we review the literature on the multiple-scale neural modeling of epilepsy and the use of such models to infer physiologic changes underlying epilepsy and epileptic seizures. The authors argue how these methods can be applied to advance the state-of-the-art in seizure forecasting.},

	abstract = {Mathematical modelling has been widely used to predict the effects of perturbations to brain networks. An important example is epilepsy surgery, where the perturbation in question is the removal of brain tissue in order to render the patient free of seizures. Different dynamical models have been proposed to represent transitions to ictal states in this context. However, our choice of which mathematical model to use to address this question relies on making assumptions regarding the mechanism that defines the transition from background to the seizure state. Since these mechanisms are unknown, it is important to understand how predictions from alternative dynamical descriptions compare. Herein we evaluate to what extent three different dynamical models provide consistent predictions for the effect of removing nodes from networks. We show that for small, directed, connected networks the three considered models provide consistent predictions. For larger networks, predictions are shown to be less consistent. However consistency is higher in networks that have sufficiently large differences in ictogenicity between nodes. We further demonstrate that heterogeneity in ictogenicity across nodes correlates with variability in the number of connections for each node.},

	abstract = {The longstanding dichotomy between the concepts of “focal” and “primary generalized” epilepsy has become increasingly blurred, raising fundamental questions about the nature of ictal onset in localized brain regions versus large-scale brain networks. We hypothesize that whether an EEG discharge appears focal or generalized is driven by the pattern of connections in brain networks, irrespective of the presence of focal brain abnormality. Using a computational model of a simple “brain” consisting of four regions and the connections between them, we explored the effects of altering connectivity structure versus the effects of introducing an “abnormal” brain region, and the interactions between these factors. Computer simulations demonstrated that electroencephalography (EEG) discharges representing either generalized or focal seizures arose purely as a consequence of subtle changes in network structure, without the requirement for any localized pathologic brain region. Furthermore we found that introducing a pathologic region gave rise to focal, secondary generalized, or primary generalized seizures depending on the network structure. Counterintuitively, we found that decreasing connectivity between regions of the brain increased the frequency of seizure-like activity. Our findings may enlighten current controversies surrounding the concepts of focal and generalized epilepsy, and help to explain recent observations in genetic animal models and human epilepsies, where loss of white matter pathways was associated with the occurrence of seizures.},

Within the field of neuroscience, specifically in electrophysiological neuroimaging, researchers are starting to explore leveraging deep learning to make predictions on their data without extensive feature engineering. This paper compares deep learning using minimally processed EEG raw data versus deep learning using EEG spectral features using two different deep convolutional neural architectures. One of them from Putten et al. (2018) is tailored to process raw data; the other was derived from the VGG16 vision network (Simonyan and Zisserman, 2015) which is designed to process EEG spectral features. We apply them to classify sex on 24-channel EEG from a large corpus of 1,574 participants. Not only do we improve on state-of-the-art classification performance for this type of classification problem, but we also show that in all cases, raw data classification leads to superior performance as compared to spectral EEG features. Interestingly we show that the neural network tailored to process EEG spectral features has increased performance when applied to raw data classification. Our approach suggests that the same convolutional networks used to process EEG spectral features yield superior performance when applied to EEG raw data.},

	abstract = {Photosensitive epilepsy (PSE) is the most common form of human reflex epilepsy, appearing in up to 10\% of epileptic children. It also offers a highly reproducible model to investigate whether changes in neuronal activity preceding the transition to an epileptic photoparoxysmal response (PPR) may be detected. We studied 10 patients with idiopathic PSE (eight female, mean age 26 years, range 9–51 years) using magnetoencephalography. In addition, we also studied the responses of five normal controls (mean age 24 years, age range 9–35 years) and three non‐photosensitive epileptic patients (mean age 10 years, range 8–11 years). Spectral analysis of the MEG signals recorded during intermittent photic stimulation revealed relevant information in the phase spectrum. To quantify this effect, we introduced a second order response feature of the stimulus‐triggered visual response preceding the PPR: the phase clustering index, which measures how close the phases of successive periods are grouped for each frequency component for all periods of the stimuli applied. We recorded a total of 86 PPRs, including several absence seizures, in nine of the 10 patients. We found that an enhancement of phase synchrony in the gamma‐band (30–120 Hz), harmonically related to the frequency of stimulation, preceded the stimulation trials that evolved into PPRs, and differed significantly from that encountered in trials not followed by PPR or in control subjects. This novel finding leads us to postulate that a pathological deviation of normally occurring synchronization of gamma oscillations, underlying perceptional processes, mediates the epileptic transition in PSE.},

A practical result was the first demonstration that human seizures have distinct initiation and termination dynamics, an important characterization as we seek to better understand how seizures start and stop.

Organized by the Universities of Pennsylvania and Bonn, and funded by grants from the American Epilepsy Society, the German Section of the International League against Epilepsy, and the German Section of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology, the workshop was attended by 51 researchers from 16 centers in seven countries. There were four major goals for the workshop: (1) to host a one-day didactic session on the science of seizure prediction, with lectures by leaders in the field; (2) to assess the current state of the field by applying current methods used to predict seizures to a shared set of continuous intracranial EEG data and discussing the strengths and weaknesses of each approach; (3) to establish a consensus on minimal data requirements, a common nomenclature, and objective methods for comparing system performance across platforms and laboratories for seizure prediction research; and most importantly (4) to establish a multi-laboratory, international working group dedicated to understanding seizure generation and making on-line, prospective seizure prediction a reality. Following the didactic course, each participating group presented their results, after applying their seizure prediction methods to five common data sets agreed upon in advance and distributed before the meeting. What follows is a description of the shared data set used for analysis, a summary of the major discussion points from the workshop, and points of consensus among the group. The brief discussion serves as a common introduction to the research papers that follow in this issue, and the description of the shared data is referenced in each of these papers. Participants in the workshop are listed at the end of the Conclusions section, in alphabetical order.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.06222},
	abstract = {Change point detection is an important part of time series analysis, as the presence of a change point indicates an abrupt and significant change in the data generating process. While many algorithms for change point detection exist, little attention has been paid to evaluating their performance on real-world time series. Algorithms are typically evaluated on simulated data and a small number of commonly-used series with unreliable ground truth. Clearly this does not provide sufficient insight into the comparative performance of these algorithms. Therefore, instead of developing yet another change point detection method, we consider it vastly more important to properly evaluate existing algorithms on real-world data. To achieve this, we present the first data set specifically designed for the evaluation of change point detection algorithms, consisting of 37 time series from various domains. Each time series was annotated by five expert human annotators to provide ground truth on the presence and location of change points. We analyze the consistency of the human annotators, and describe evaluation metrics that can be used to measure algorithm performance in the presence of multiple ground truth annotations. Subsequently, we present a benchmark study where 14 existing algorithms are evaluated on each of the time series in the data set. This study shows that binary segmentation (Scott and Knott, 1974) and Bayesian online change point detection (Adams and MacKay, 2007) are among the best performing methods. Our aim is that this data set will serve as a proving ground in the development of novel change point detection algorithms.},

Our method is devised to detect possibly subtle disruptions in normal brain functioning that precede the onset of an epileptic seizure. Moreover, it is able to capture the evolution of seizure spread from one region (or channel) to another. The proposed frequency-specific change-point detection method (FreSpeD) deploys a cumulative sum-type test statistic within a binary segmentation algorithm. We demonstrate the theoretical properties of FreSpeD and show its robustness to parameter choice and advantages against two competing methods. Furthermore, the FreSpeD method produces directly interpretable output. When applied to epileptic seizure EEG data, FreSpeD identifies the correct brain region as the focal point of seizure and the timing of the seizure onset. Moreover, FreSpeD detects changes in cross-coherence immediately before seizure onset which indicate an evolution leading up to the seizure. These changes are subtle and were not captured by the methods that previously analyzed the same EEG data. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.},

Yet, what is meant by “computational model” is understood in many different ways by researchers in different fields of neuroscience and psychology, hindering communication and collaboration. In this review, we point out the state of the art of computational modeling in Electroencephalography (EEG) and outline how these models can be used to integrate findings from electrophysiology, network-level models, and behavior. On the one hand, computational models serve to investigate the mechanisms that generate brain activity, for example measured with EEG, such as the transient emergence of oscillations at different frequency bands and/or with different spatial topographies. On the other hand, computational models serve to design experiments and test hypotheses in silico. The final purpose of computational models of EEG is to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms that underlie the EEG signal. This is crucial for an accurate interpretation of EEG measurements that may ultimately serve in the development of novel clinical applications.},

	abstract = {In the context of science, the well-known adage "a picture is worth a thousand words" might well be "a model is worth a thousand datasets." Scientific models, such as Newtonian physics or biological gene regulatory networks, are human-driven simplifications of complex phenomena that serve as surrogates for the countless experiments that validated the models. Recently, machine learning has been able to overcome the inaccuracies of approximate modeling by directly learning the entire set of nonlinear interactions from data. However, without any predetermined structure from the scientific basis behind the problem, machine learning approaches are flexible but data-expensive, requiring large databases of homogeneous labeled training data. A central challenge is reconciling data that is at odds with simplified models without requiring "big data". In this work we develop a new methodology, universal differential equations (UDEs), which augments scientific models with machine-learnable structures for scientifically-based learning. We show how UDEs can be utilized to discover previously unknown governing equations, accurately extrapolate beyond the original data, and accelerate model simulation, all in a time and data-efficient manner. This advance is coupled with open-source software that allows for training UDEs which incorporate physical constraints, delayed interactions, implicitly-defined events, and intrinsic stochasticity in the model. Our examples show how a diverse set of computationally-difficult modeling issues across scientific disciplines, from automatically discovering biological mechanisms to accelerating the training of physics-informed neural networks and large-eddy simulations, can all be transformed into UDE training problems that are efficiently solved by a single software methodology.},

	abstract = {Multi-horizon forecasting often contains a complex mix of inputs – including static (i.e. time-invariant) covariates, known future inputs, and other exogenous time series that are only observed in the past – without any prior information on how they interact with the target. Several deep learning methods have been proposed, but they are typically ‘black-box’ models that do not shed light on how they use the full range of inputs present in practical scenarios. In this paper, we introduce the Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) – a novel attention-based architecture that combines high-performance multi-horizon forecasting with interpretable insights into temporal dynamics. To learn temporal relationships at different scales, TFT uses recurrent layers for local processing and interpretable self-attention layers for long-term dependencies. TFT utilizes specialized components to select relevant features and a series of gating layers to suppress unnecessary components, enabling high performance in a wide range of scenarios. On a variety of real-world datasets, we demonstrate significant performance improvements over existing benchmarks, and highlight three practical interpretability use cases of TFT.},

The human epileptic brain is often considered as a prototypical system, given the devastating and, at times, even life-threatening nature of the extreme event epileptic seizure. More than three decades of international effort has successfully identified predictors of imminent seizures. However, the suitability of typically applied early warning indicators for critical slowing down, namely, variance and lag-1 autocorrelation, for indexing seizure susceptibility is still controversially discussed. Here, we investigated long-term, multichannel recordings of brain dynamics from 28 subjects with epilepsy. Using a surrogate-based evaluation procedure of sensitivity and specificity of time-resolved estimates of early warning indicators, we found no evidence for critical slowing down prior to 105 epileptic seizures.},

Here we propose that broadband power spectra characterize recurrent neural networks of nodes (neurons or clusters of neurons), endowed with an effective balance between excitation and inhibition tuned to keep the network on the edge of dynamical instability. These networks show a fast mode reﬂecting local dynamics and a slow mode emerging from distributed recurrent connections. Together, the 2 modes produce power spectra similar to those observed in human intracranial EEG (i.e., electrocorticography, ECoG) recordings. Moreover, such networks convert spatial input correlations across nodes into temporal autocorrelation of network activity. Consequently, increased independence between nodes reduces low-frequency power, which may explain changes observed during behavioral tasks. Lastly, varying network coupling causes activity changes that resemble those observed in human ECoG across different arousal states. The model links macroscopic features of empirical ECoG power to a parsimonious underlying network structure, and suggests mechanisms for changes observed across behavioral and arousal states. This work provides a computational framework to generate and test hypotheses about cellular and network mechanisms underlying whole brain electrical dynamics, their variations across states, and potential alterations in brain diseases.},

However, commonly used forecasting methods are not suited for handling non-stationarity, while existing methods for forecasting in non-stationary time series are often complex to implement and involve expensive computations. We introduce a Gaussian process-based model for handling of non-stationarity. The warping is achieved non-parametrically, through imposing a prior on the relative change of distance between subsequent observation inputs. The model allows the use of general gradient optimization algorithms for training and incurs only a small computational overhead on training and prediction. The model finds its applications in forecasting in non-stationary time series with either gradually varying volatility, presence of change points, or a combination thereof. We implement the model in a probabilistic programming framework, evaluate on synthetic and real-world time series data comparing against both broadly used baselines and known state-of-the-art approaches and show that the model exhibits state-of-the-art forecasting performance at a lower implementation and computation cost, enabling efficient applications in diverse fields of system monitoring and novelty detection..},

	abstract = {Time series forecasting is often fundamental to scientiﬁc and engineering problems and enables decision making. With ever increasing data set sizes, a trivial solution to scale up predictions is to assume independence between interacting time series. However, modeling statistical dependencies can improve accuracy and enable analysis of interaction effects. Deep learning methods are well suited for this problem, but multivariate models often assume a simple parametric distribution and do not scale to high dimensions. In this work we model the multivariate temporal dynamics of time series via an autoregressive deep learning model, where the data distribution is represented by a conditioned normalizing ﬂow. This combination retains the power of autoregressive models, such as good performance in extrapolation into the future, with the ﬂexibility of ﬂows as a general purpose high-dimensional distribution model, while remaining computationally tractable. We show that it improves over the state-of-the-art for standard metrics on many real-world data sets with several thousand interacting time-series.},

Therefore, it is important to accurately analyze and recognize epilepsy based on EEG signals, and for a long time, researchers have attempted to extract new features from the signals for epilepsy recognition. However, it is very difficult to select useful features from a large number of them in this diagnostic application. As the development of artificial intelligence progresses, unsupervised feature learning based on the deep learning model can obtain features that can better describe identified objects from unlabeled data. In this paper, the deep convolution network and autoencoders-based model, named as AE-CDNN, is constructed in order to perform unsupervised feature learning from EEG in epilepsy. We extract features by AE-CDNN model and classify the features based on two public EEG data sets. Experimental results showed that the classification results of features obtained by AE-CDNN are more optimal than features obtained by principal component analysis and sparse random projection. Using several common classifiers to classify features obtained by AE-CDNN model results in high accuracy and not inferior to the research results from most recent studies. The results also showed that the features of AE-CDNN model are clear, effective, and easy to learn. These features can speed up the convergence and reduce the training times of classifiers. Therefore, the AE-CDNN model can be effectively applied to feature extraction of EEG in epilepsy.},

In this paper, these properties are exploited to develop two methods of highlighting the presence of neonatal seizures from electroencephalograph (EEG) signals. In the first method, the certainty of the GP model prediction is used to indicate the presence of seizures. In the second approach, the hyperparameters of the GP model are used. Tests are carried out with a feature set of ten EEG measures developed from various signal processing techniques. Features are evaluated using a neural network classifier on 51 h of real neonatal EEG. The GP measures, in particular, the prediction certainty approach, produce a high level of performance compared to other modeling methods and methods currently in clinical use for EEG analysis, indicating that they are an important and useful tool for the real-time detection of neonatal seizures.},

One can then ask, for an arbitrary individual’s brain: given recordings from a limited set of locations in that individual’s brain, along with the observed spatial correlations learned from other people’s recordings, how much can be inferred about ongoing activity at other locations throughout that individual’s brain?

	abstract = {The analysis of nonstationary time series is of great importance in many scientific fields such as physics and neuroscience. In recent years, Gaussian process regression has attracted substantial attention as a robust and powerful method for analyzing time series. In this paper, we introduce a new framework for analyzing nonstationary time series using locally stationary Gaussian process analysis with parameters that are coupled through a hidden Markov model. The main advantage of this framework is that arbitrary complex nonstationary covariance functions can be obtained by combining simpler stationary building blocks whose hidden parameters can be estimated in closed-form. We demonstrate the flexibility of the method by analyzing two examples of synthetic nonstationary signals: oscillations with time varying frequency and time series with two dynamical states. Finally, we report an example application on real magnetoencephalographic measurements of brain activity.},

	abstract = {The cortex is a complex system, characterized by its dynamics and architecture, which underlie many functions such as action, perception, learning, language, and cognition. Its structural architecture has been studied for more than a hundred years; however, its dynamics have been addressed much less thoroughly. In this paper, we review and integrate, in a unifying framework, a variety of computational approaches that have been used to characterize the dynamics of the cortex, as evidenced at different levels of measurement. Computational models at different space–time scales help us understand the fundamental mechanisms that underpin neural processes and relate these processes to neuroscience data. Modeling at the single neuron level is necessary because this is the level at which information is exchanged between the computing elements of the brain; the neurons. Mesoscopic models tell us how neural elements interact to yield emergent behavior at the level of microcolumns and cortical columns. Macroscopic models can inform us about whole brain dynamics and interactions between large-scale neural systems such as cortical regions, the thalamus, and brain stem. Each level of description relates uniquely to neuroscience data, from single-unit recordings, through local field potentials to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), electroencephalogram (EEG), and magnetoencephalogram (MEG). Models of the cortex can establish which types of large-scale neuronal networks can perform computations and characterize their emergent properties. Mean-field and related formulations of dynamics also play an essential and complementary role as forward models that can be inverted given empirical data. This makes dynamic models critical in integrating theory and experiments. We argue that elaborating principled and informed models is a prerequisite for grounding empirical neuroscience in a cogent theoretical framework, commensurate with the achievements in the physical sciences.},

The coexistence region exists when the amount of information used by the agents to make their choices is greater than a critical value which is related to the point at which there is a phase transition in the standard minority game.},

Refractory status epilepticus (RSE) and depolarization block (DB) are other pathological brain activities linked to epilepsy, whose patterns are different and whose mechanisms remain poorly understood. In epileptogenic network modeling, the Epileptor is a generic phenomenological model that has been recently developed to describe the dynamics of seizures. Here, we performed a detailed qualitative analysis of the Epileptor model based on dynamical systems theory and bifurcation analysis, and investigate the dynamic evolution of “normal” activity toward seizures and to the pathological RSE and DB states. The mechanisms of the transition between states are called bifurcations. Our detailed analysis demonstrates that the generic model undergoes different bifurcation types at seizure offset, when varying some selected parameters. We show that the pathological and normal activities can coexist within the same model under some conditions, and demonstrate that there are many pathways leading to and away from these activities. We here archive systematically all behaviors and dynamic regimes of the Epileptor model to serve as a resource in the development of patient-specific brain network models, and more generally in epilepsy research.},

In this work, we propose a model that, appropriately tuned, can display several types of bursting behaviors. The model contains two subsystems acting at different time scales. For the fast subsystem we use the planar unfolding of a high codimension singularity. In its bifurcation diagram, we locate paths that underlie the right sequence of bifurcations necessary for bursting. The slow subsystem steers the fast one back and forth along these paths leading to bursting behavior. The model is able to produce almost all the classes of bursting predicted for systems with a planar fast subsystem. Transitions between classes can be obtained through an ultra-slow modulation of the model’s parameters. A detailed exploration of the parameter space allows predicting possible transitions. This provides a single framework to understand the coexistence of diverse bursting patterns in physical and biological systems or in models.},

The correlation structure ("functional connectivity") of these fluctuations recapitulates the large-scale functional organization of the brain. However, a unifying physiological account of this structure has so far been lacking. Here, using fMRI in humans, we show that ongoing arousal fluctuations are associated with global waves of activity that slowly propagate in parallel throughout the neocortex, thalamus, striatum, and cerebellum. We show that these waves can parsimoniously account for many features of spontaneous fMRI signal fluctuations, including topographically organized functional connectivity. Last, we demonstrate similar, cortex-wide propagation of neural activity measured with electrocorticography in macaques. These findings suggest that traveling waves spatiotemporally pattern brain-wide excitability in relation to arousal.},

We propose that both dynamics reflect two faces of the same recurrent loop mechanism: an integration device that accumulates ongoing stochastic activity and, either spontaneously or in a task-driven manner, crosses a dynamic threshold and ignites, leading to content-specific awareness. The hypothesis can explain a rich set of behavioral and neuronal phenomena, such as perceptual threshold, the high non-linearity of visual responses, the subliminal nature of spontaneous activity fluctuations, and the slow activity buildup anticipating spontaneous behavior (e.g., readiness potential). Further elaborations of this unified scheme, such as a cascade of integrators with different ignition thresholds or multi-stable states, can account for additional complexities in the repertoire of human cortical dynamics.},

	abstract = {It is well known that reinforcement learning can be cast as inference in an appropriate probabilistic model. However, this commonly involves introducing a distribution over agent trajectories with probabilities proportional to exponentiated rewards. In this work, we formulate reinforcement learning as Bayesian inference without resorting to rewards, and show that rewards are derived from agent's preferences, rather than the other way around. We argue that agent preferences should be specified stochastically rather than deterministically. Reinforcement learning via inference with stochastic preferences naturally describes agent behaviors, does not require introducing rewards and exponential weighing of trajectories, and allows to reason about agents using the solid foundation of Bayesian statistics. Stochastic conditioning, a probabilistic programming paradigm for conditioning models on distributions rather than values, is the formalism behind agents with probabilistic preferences. We demonstrate realization of our approach on case studies using both a two-agent coordinate game and a single agent acting in a noisy environment, showing that despite superficial differences, both cases can be modeled and reasoned about based on the same principles.},

We verify the expected performance of chance prediction using Monte Carlo simulations that generate random, simulated seizure warnings of variable duration. We propose a new test metric, the difference between algorithm and chance sensitivities given a constraint on proportion of time spent in warning, and use a simple spectral power-based measure to demonstrate the utility of the metric in four patients undergoing intracranial EEG monitoring during evaluation for epilepsy surgery.

Recent advances in fundamental neuroscience and implantable electronics have enabled the development of neuromodulation devices for the treatment of epilepsy. Modern neuromodulation devices detect abnormal electrical activity in the brain associated with seizures and activate electrical stimulation to prevent seizures from occurring. Today, there is a growing trend towards integrating machine learning for seizure detection on such devices to improve their efficacy. This thesis assesses the suitability of current machine learning models for neuromodulation devices by evaluating their seizure detection performance and efficiency in resource-constrained environments. Particular emphasis is placed on comparing traditional machine learning to modern deep learning models. This thesis will show that, in the seizure detection context, deep learning models can be implemented in a compact and resource-efficient way despite their computational complexity.},

	abstract = {This paper is concerned with Electroencephalography (EEG) seizure prediction, which means the detection of the pre-ictal state prior to ictal activity occurrence. The basic idea of the proposed approach for EEG seizure prediction is to work on the signals in the Hilbert domain. The operation in the Hilbert domain guarantees working on the low-pass spectra of EEG signal segments to avoid artifacts. Signal attributes in the Hilbert domain including amplitude, derivative, local mean, local variance, and median are analyzed statistically to perform the channel selection and seizure prediction tasks. Pre-defined prediction and false-alarm probabilities are set to select the channels, the attributes, and bins of probability density functions (PDFs) that can be useful for seizure prediction. Due to the multi-channel nature of this process, there is a need for a majority voting strategy to take a decision for each signal segment. Simulation results reveal an average prediction rate of 96.46\%, an average false-alarm rate of 0.028077/h and an average prediction time of 60.1595 min for a 90-min prediction horizon.},

	abstract = {Objective A fundamental challenge in treating epilepsy is that changes in observed seizure frequencies do not necessarily reflect changes in underlying seizure risk. Rather, changes in seizure frequency may occur due to probabilistic variation around an underlying seizure risk state caused by normal fluctuations from natural history, leading to seizure unpredictability and potentially suboptimal medication adjustments in epilepsy management. However, no rigorous statistical approach exists to systematically distinguish expected changes in seizure frequency due to natural variability from changes in underlying seizure risk. Methods Using data from SeizureTracker.com, a patient-reported seizure diary tool containing over 1.2 million recorded seizures across 8 years, a novel epilepsy seizure risk assessment tool (EpiSAT) employing a Bayesian mixed-effects hidden Markov model for zero-inflated count data was developed to estimate changes in underlying seizure risk using patient-reported seizure diary and clinical measurement data. Accuracy for correctly assessing underlying seizure risk was evaluated through a simulation comparison. Implications for the natural history of tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) were assessed using data from SeizureTracker.com. Results EpiSAT led to significant improvement in seizure risk assessment compared to traditional approaches relying solely on observed seizure frequencies. Applied to TSC, four underlying seizure risk states were identified. The expected duration of each state was {\textless}12 months, providing a data-driven estimate of the amount of time a person with TSC would be expected to remain at the same seizure risk level according to the natural course of epilepsy. Significance We propose a novel Bayesian statistical approach for evaluating seizure risk on an individual patient level using patient-reported seizure diaries, which allows for the incorporation of external clinical variables to assess impact on seizure risk. This tool may improve the ability to distinguish true changes in seizure risk from natural variations in seizure frequency in clinical practice. Incorporation of systematic statistical approaches into antiepileptic drug (AED) management may help improve understanding of seizure unpredictability as well as timing of treatment interventions for people with epilepsy.},

	abstract = {Background
An implanted device for brain-responsive neurostimulation (RNS® System) is approved as an effective treatment to reduce seizures in adults with medically-refractory focal epilepsy. Clinical trials of the RNS System demonstrate population-level reduction in average seizure frequency, but therapeutic response is highly variable.
Hypothesis
Recent evidence links seizures to cyclical fluctuations in underlying risk. We tested the hypothesis that effectiveness of responsive neurostimulation varies based on current state within cyclical risk fluctuations.
Methods
We analyzed retrospective data from 25 adults with medically-refractory focal epilepsy implanted with the RNS System. Chronic electrocorticography was used to record electrographic seizures, and hidden Markov models decoded seizures into fluctuations in underlying risk. State-dependent associations of RNS System stimulation parameters with changes in risk were estimated.
Results
Higher charge density was associated with improved outcomes, both for remaining in a low seizure risk state and for transitioning from a high to a low seizure risk state. The effect of stimulation frequency depended on initial seizure risk state: when starting in a low risk state, higher stimulation frequencies were associated with remaining in a low risk state, but when starting in a high risk state, lower stimulation frequencies were associated with transition to a low risk state. Findings were consistent across bipolar and monopolar stimulation configurations.
Conclusion
The impact of RNS on seizure frequency exhibits state-dependence, such that stimulation parameters which are effective in one seizure risk state may not be effective in another. These findings represent conceptual advances in understanding the therapeutic mechanism of RNS, and directly inform current practices of RNS tuning and the development of next-generation neurostimulation systems.},

In neuroscience, recordings are strongly limited by subsampling. Here, the subsampling-invariant estimator allows to revisit two prominent hypotheses about the brain’s collective spiking dynamics: asynchronous-irregular or critical. We identify consistently for rat, cat, and monkey a state that combines features of both and allows input to reverberate in the network for hundreds of milliseconds. Overall, owing to its ready applicability, the novel estimator paves the way to novel insight for the study of spatially extended dynamical systems.},

	abstract = {Epileptic seizures are characterized by abnormal and excessive neural activity, where cortical network dynamics seem to become unstable. However, most of the time, during seizure-free periods, cortex of epilepsy patients shows perfectly stable dynamics. This raises the question of how recurring instability can arise in the light of this stable default state. In this work, we examine two potential scenarios of seizure generation: (i) epileptic cortical areas might generally operate closer to instability, which would make epilepsy patients generally more susceptible to seizures, or (ii) epileptic cortical areas might drift systematically towards instability before seizure onset. We analyzed single-unit spike recordings from both the epileptogenic (focal) and the nonfocal cortical hemispheres of 20 epilepsy patients. We quantified the distance to instability in the framework of criticality, using a novel estimator, which enables an unbiased inference from a small set of recorded neurons. Surprisingly, we found no evidence for either scenario: Neither did focal areas generally operate closer to instability, nor were seizures preceded by a drift towards instability. In fact, our results from both pre-seizure and seizure-free intervals suggest that despite epilepsy, human cortex operates in the stable, slightly subcritical regime, just like cortex of other healthy mammalians.},

	abstract = {Purpose
To summarize definitions, prevalence, risk factors, consequences, and acute management of seizure clusters using rescue medications.
Methods
We searched MEDLINE for studies that assessed definitions, clinical characteristics, outcomes, and use of rescue medication for aborting seizure clusters.
Results
Different clinical and statistical definitions for seizure clusters have been proposed, including: ≥3 seizures in 24 h, ≥2 seizures in 24 h, and ≥2 seizures in 6 h. Most studies of seizure clusters have been conducted in tertiary epilepsy centers, with refractory epilepsy patients. Patients with severe and poorly controlled epilepsy are more likely to experience seizure clusters. Seizure clusters can result in increased health care utilization and have negative impact on the quality of life of patients and caregivers. Use of benzodiazepine rescue medications in acute management of seizure clusters can help avoid progression to status epilepticus and reduce emergency room visits. Rescue medications are underutilized in seizure clusters. Currently, rectal diazepam gel is the only FDA approved rescue medication for seizure clusters. In addition, buccal midazolam is approved in European countries for treatment of prolonged seizures. However, various non-rectal non-IV benzodiazepines are safe and effective in treating acute seizures and clusters. Most patients and caregivers preferred non-rectal routes.
Conclusion
Identifying patients that are at high risk for seizure clusters, providing them with formal action plans and educating them about use of rescue medication for seizure clusters can help ameliorate the outcomes in this group of epilepsy patients.},

	abstract = {Critical dynamics are assumed to be an attractive mode for normal brain functioning as information processing and computational capabilities are found to be optimal in the critical state. Recent experimental observations of neuronal activity patterns following power-law distributions, a hallmark of systems at a critical state, have led to the hypothesis that human brain dynamics could be poised at a phase transition between ordered and disordered activity. A so far unresolved question concerns the medical significance of critical brain activity and how it relates to pathological conditions. Using data from invasive electroencephalogram recordings from humans we show that during epileptic seizure attacks neuronal activity patterns deviate from the normally observed power-law distribution characterizing critical dynamics. The comparison of these observations to results from a computational model exhibiting self-organized criticality (SOC) based on adaptive networks allows further insights into the underlying dynamics. Together these results suggest that brain dynamics deviates from criticality during seizures caused by the failure of adaptive SOC.},

Some event types are stochastically excited or inhibited---in the sense of having their probabilities elevated or decreased---by patterns in the sequence of previous events. Discovering such patterns can help us predict which type of event will happen next and when. We model streams of discrete events in continuous time, by constructing a neurally self-modulating multivariate point process in which the intensities of multiple event types evolve according to a novel continuous-time LSTM. This generative model allows past events to influence the future in complex and realistic ways, by conditioning future event intensities on the hidden state of a recurrent neural network that has consumed the stream of past events. Our model has desirable qualitative properties. It achieves competitive likelihood and predictive accuracy on real and synthetic datasets, including under missing-data conditions.},

Detection of seizure clusters is currently based on simple clinical rules, such as two seizures separated by four or fewer hours or multiple seizures in 24 h. Current deﬁnitions fail to distinguish between statistically signiﬁcant clusters and those that may result from natural variation in the person’s seizures. Ability to systematically deﬁne when a seizure cluster is signiﬁcant for the individual carries major implications for treatment. However, there is no uniform consensus on how to deﬁne seizure clusters. This study proposes a principled statistical approach to deﬁning seizure clusters that addresses these issues.},

In general, traditional statistical TPP models are more interpretable and less data ravenous, which lay their success on appropriate selection of the intensity function via domain knowledge. In contrast, emerging network based models have higher capacity to digest massive event data with less reliance on model selection. However their physical meaning becomes less comprehensible.

We prove that determinantal and permanental processes, as well as, more generally, negatively and positively associated point processes are comparable in this sense to the Poisson point process of the same mean measure. We provide some motivating results and preview further ones, showing that the new tool is relevant in the study of macroscopic, percolative properties of point processes. This new comparison is also implied by the directionally convex (\$dcx\$ ordering of point processes, which has already been shown to be relevant to comparison of spatial homogeneity of point processes. For this latter ordering, using a notion of lattice perturbation, we provide a large monotone spectrum of comparable point processes, ranging from periodic grids to Cox processes, and encompassing Poisson point process as well. They are intended to serve as a platform for further theoretical and numerical studies of clustering, as well as simple models of random point patterns to be used in applications where neither complete regularity northe total independence property are not realistic assumptions.},

The processes are constructed by means of the thinning operation of Joe (1996), generalizing the binomial thinning used by McKenzie (1986, 1988) and Al-Osh and Alzaid (1987) for integer-valued time series. As a special case we obtain a class of autoregressive moving average processes that are different from the ARMA models proposed by Joe (1996). The range of possible marginal distributions for the new models is extensive and includes all infinitely divisible distributions with finite moment generating functions, hereunder many known discrete, continuous and mixed distributions.},

	abstract = {Random point patterns are ubiquitous in nature, and statistical models such as point processes, i.e., algorithms that generate stochastic collections of points, are commonly used to simulate and interpret them. We propose an application of quantum computing to statistical modeling by establishing a connection between point processes and Gaussian Boson Sampling, an algorithm for special-purpose photonic quantum computers. We show that Gaussian Boson Sampling can be used to implement a class of point processes based on hard-to-compute matrix functions which, in general, are intractable to simulate classically. We also discuss situations where polynomial-time classical methods exist. This leads to a family of efficient quantum-inspired point processes, including a new fast classical algorithm for permanental point processes. We investigate the statistical properties of point processes based on Gaussian Boson Sampling and reveal their defining property: like bosons that bunch together, they generate collections of points that form clusters. Finally, we discuss several additional properties of these point processes which we illustrate with example applications.},

However, the predictive performance of purely unsupervised anomaly detection often fails to match the required detection rates in many tasks and there exists a need for labeled data to guide the model generation. Our ﬁrst contribution shows that classical semi-supervised approaches, originating from a supervised classiﬁer, are inappropriate and hardly detect new and unknown anomalies. We argue that semi-supervised anomaly detection needs to ground on the unsupervised learning paradigm and devise a novel algorithm that meets this requirement. Although being intrinsically non-convex, we further show that the optimization problem has a convex equivalent under relatively mild assumptions. Additionally, we propose an active learning strategy to automatically ﬁlter candidates for labeling. In an empirical study on network intrusion detection data, we observe that the proposed learning methodology requires much less labeled data than the state-of-the-art, while achieving higher detection accuracies.},

Here, we examine false and missing alarms of two algorithms on long-term datasets to show that the limitations are less related to classiﬁers or features, but rather to intrinsic changes in the data.
Methods: We evaluated two algorithms on three datasets by computing the correlation of false predictions and estimating the information transfer between both classiﬁcation methods.
Results: For 9 out of 12 individuals both methods showed a performance better than chance. For all individuals we observed a positive correlation in predictions. For individuals with strong correlation in false predictions we were able to boost the performance of one method by excluding test samples based on the results of the second method.
Conclusions: Substantially different algorithms exhibit a highly consistent performance and a strong coherency in false and missing alarms. Hence, changing the underlying hypothesis of a preictal state of ﬁxed time length prior to each seizure to a proictal state is more helpful than further optimizing classiﬁers.},

In [1] a p-value estimator is proposed which is based on ranking some statistic over all data samples, and is shown to be asymptotically consistent. Relying on this framework we propose a new statistic for p-value estimation. It is based on the average of K nearest neighbor (K-NN) distances of η within a K-NN graph constructed from n nominal training samples. We also provide a bootstrapping strategy for estimating p-values which leads to better robustness. We then theoretically justify the asymptotic consistency of our ideas through a finite sample analysis. Synthetic and real experiments demonstrate the superiorities of our scheme.},

	abstract = {The theory of critical slowing down, i.e. the increasing recovery times of complex systems close to tipping points, has been proposed as an early warning signal for collapse. Empirical evidence for the reality of such warning signals is still rare in ecology. We studied this on Zostera noltii intertidal seagrass meadows at their southern range limit, the Banc d’Arguin, Mauritania. We analyse the environmental covariates of recovery rates using structural equation modelling (SEM), based on an experiment in which we assessed whether recovery after disturbances (i.e. seagrass \& infauna removal) depends on stress intensity (increasing with elevation) and disturbance patch size (1 m2 vs. 9 m2). The SEM analyses revealed that higher biofilm density and sediment accretion best explained seagrass recovery rates. Experimental disturbances were followed by slow rates of recovery, regrowth occurring mainly in the coolest months of the year. Macrofauna recolonisation lagged behind seagrass recovery. Overall, the recovery rate was six times slower in the high intertidal zone than in the low zone. The large disturbances in the low zone recovered faster than the small ones in the high zone. This provides empirical evidence for critical slowing down with increasing desiccation stress in an intertidal seagrass system.},

	abstract = {Objective Seizure unpredictability is rated as one of the most challenging aspects of living with epilepsy. Seizure likelihood can be influenced by a range of environmental and physiological factors that are difficult to measure and quantify. However, some generalizable patterns have been demonstrated in seizure onset. A majority of people with epilepsy exhibit circadian rhythms in their seizure times, and many also show slower, multiday patterns. Seizure cycles can be measured using a range of recording modalities, including self-reported electronic seizure diaries. This study aimed to develop personalized forecasts from a mobile seizure diary app. Methods Forecasts based on circadian and multiday seizure cycles were tested pseudoprospectively using data from 50 app users (mean of 109 seizures per subject). Individuals' strongest cycles were estimated from their reported seizure times and used to derive the likelihood of future seizures. The forecasting approach was validated using self-reported events and electrographic seizures from the Neurovista dataset, an existing database of long-term electroencephalography that has been widely used to develop forecasting algorithms. Results The validation dataset showed that forecasts of seizure likelihood based on self-reported cycles were predictive of electrographic seizures for approximately half the cohort. Forecasts using only mobile app diaries allowed users to spend an average of 67.1\% of their time in a low-risk state, with 14.8\% of their time in a high-risk warning state. On average, 69.1\% of seizures occurred during high-risk states and 10.5\% of seizures occurred in low-risk states. Significance Seizure diary apps can provide personalized forecasts of seizure likelihood that are accurate and clinically relevant for electrographic seizures. These results have immediate potential for translation to a prospective seizure forecasting trial using a mobile diary app. It is our hope that seizure forecasting apps will one day give people with epilepsy greater confidence in managing their daily activities.},

	abstract = {{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Abstract{\textless}/h3{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}For persons with epilepsy, much suffering stems from the apparent unpredictability of seizures. Historically, efforts to predict seizures have sought to detect changes in brain activity in the seconds to minutes preceding seizures (pre-ictal period), a timeframe that limits preventative interventions. Recently, converging evidence from studies using chronic intracranial electroencephalography revealed that brain activity in epilepsy has a robust cyclical structure over hours (circadian) and days (multidien). These cycles organize pro-ictal states, hours-to days-long periods of heightened seizure risk, raising the possibility of forecasting seizures over horizons longer than the pre-ictal period. Here, using cEEG from 18 subjects, we developed point-process generalized linear models incorporating cyclical variables at multiple time-scales to show that seizure risk can be forecasted accurately over days in most subjects. Personalized risk-stratification days in advance of seizures is unprecedented and may enable novel preventative strategies.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Seizure prediction would be clinically useful in patients with epilepsy and could improve safety, increase independence, and allow acute treatment. We did a multicentre clinical feasibility study to assess the safety and efficacy of a long-term implanted seizure advisory system designed to predict seizure likelihood and quantify seizures in adults with drug-resistant focal seizures.
METHODS: We enrolled patients at three centres in Melbourne, Australia, between March 24, 2010, and June 21, 2011. Eligible patients had between two and 12 disabling partial-onset seizures per month, a lateralised epileptogenic zone, and no history of psychogenic seizures. After devices were surgically implanted, patients entered a data collection phase, during which an algorithm for identification of periods of high, moderate, and low seizure likelihood was established. If the algorithm met performance criteria (ie, sensitivity of high-likelihood warnings greater than 65\% and performance better than expected through chance prediction of randomly occurring events), patients then entered an advisory phase and received information about seizure likelihood. The primary endpoint was the number of device-related adverse events at 4 months after implantation. Our secondary endpoints were algorithm performance at the end of the data collection phase, clinical effectiveness (measures of anxiety, depression, seizure severity, and quality of life) 4 months after initiation of the advisory phase, and longer-term adverse events. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01043406.
FINDINGS: We implanted 15 patients with the advisory system. 11 device-related adverse events were noted within four months of implantation, two of which were serious (device migration, seroma); an additional two serious adverse events occurred during the first year after implantation (device-related infection, device site reaction), but were resolved without further complication. The device met enabling criteria in 11 patients upon completion of the data collection phase, with high likelihood performance estimate sensitivities ranging from 65\% to 100\%. Three patients' algorithms did not meet performance criteria and one patient required device removal because of an adverse event before sufficient training data were acquired. We detected no significant changes in clinical effectiveness measures between baseline and 4 months after implantation.
INTERPRETATION: This study showed that intracranial electroencephalographic monitoring is feasible in ambulatory patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. If these findings are replicated in larger, longer studies, accurate definition of preictal electrical activity might improve understanding of seizure generation and eventually lead to new management strategies.

	abstract = {Objective A fundamental challenge in treating epilepsy is that changes in observed seizure frequencies do not necessarily reflect changes in underlying seizure risk. Rather, changes in seizure frequency may occur due to probabilistic variation around an underlying seizure risk state caused by normal fluctuations from natural history, leading to seizure unpredictability and potentially suboptimal medication adjustments in epilepsy management. However, no rigorous statistical approach exists to systematically distinguish expected changes in seizure frequency due to natural variability from changes in underlying seizure risk. Methods Using data from SeizureTracker.com, a patient-reported seizure diary tool containing over 1.2 million recorded seizures across 8 years, a novel epilepsy seizure risk assessment tool (EpiSAT) employing a Bayesian mixed-effects hidden Markov model for zero-inflated count data was developed to estimate changes in underlying seizure risk using patient-reported seizure diary and clinical measurement data. Accuracy for correctly assessing underlying seizure risk was evaluated through a simulation comparison. Implications for the natural history of tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) were assessed using data from SeizureTracker.com. Results EpiSAT led to significant improvement in seizure risk assessment compared to traditional approaches relying solely on observed seizure frequencies. Applied to TSC, four underlying seizure risk states were identified. The expected duration of each state was {\textless}12 months, providing a data-driven estimate of the amount of time a person with TSC would be expected to remain at the same seizure risk level according to the natural course of epilepsy. Significance We propose a novel Bayesian statistical approach for evaluating seizure risk on an individual patient level using patient-reported seizure diaries, which allows for the incorporation of external clinical variables to assess impact on seizure risk. This tool may improve the ability to distinguish true changes in seizure risk from natural variations in seizure frequency in clinical practice. Incorporation of systematic statistical approaches into antiepileptic drug (AED) management may help improve understanding of seizure unpredictability as well as timing of treatment interventions for people with epilepsy.},

	abstract = {Objective: This study investigated sensitivity and false detection rate of a multimodal automatic seizure detection algorithm and the applicability to reduced electrode montages for long-term seizure documentation in epilepsy patients.
Methods: An automatic seizure detection algorithm based on EEG, EMG, and ECG signals was developed. EEG/ECG recordings of 92 patients from two epilepsy monitoring units including 494 seizures were used to assess detection performance. EMG data were extracted by bandpass ﬁltering of EEG signals. Sensitivity and false detection rate were evaluated for each signal modality and for reduced electrode montages.
Results: All focal seizures evolving to bilateral tonic-clonic (BTCS, n = 50) and 89\% of focal seizures (FS, n = 139) were detected. Average sensitivity in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) patients was 94\% and 74\% in extratemporal lobe epilepsy (XTLE) patients. Overall detection sensitivity was 86\%. Average false detection rate was 12.8 false detections in 24 h (FD/24 h) for TLE and 22 FD/24 h in XTLE patients. Utilization of 8 frontal and temporal electrodes reduced average sensitivity from 86\% to 81\%.
Conclusion: Our automatic multimodal seizure detection algorithm shows high sensitivity with full and reduced electrode montages. Signiﬁcance: Evaluation of different signal modalities and electrode montages paces the way for semiautomatic seizure documentation systems.

We train a channel-wise feature extractor by extending the SimCLR framework to time-series data. We introduce a set of augmentations for EEG and study their efficacy on different classification tasks. We demonstrate that the learned features improve EEG classification and significantly reduce the amount of labeled data needed on three separate tasks: (1) Emotion Recognition (SEED), (2) Normal/Abnormal EEG classification (TUH), and (3) Sleep-stage scoring (SleepEDF). Our models show improved performance over previously reported supervised models on SEED and SleepEDF and self-supervised models on all three tasks.},

However, high levels of ambient noise and various interferences result in nonstationary signals, which may lead to inefficient performance of conventional methods. In this paper, we propose a nonlinear dimensionality reduction framework using diffusion maps on a learned statistical manifold, which gives rise to the construction of a low-dimensional representation of the high-dimensional nonstationary time series. We show that diffusion maps, with affinity kernels based on the Kullback–Leibler divergence between the local statistics of samples, allow for efficient approximation of pairwise geodesic distances. To construct the statistical manifold, we estimate time-evolving parametric distributions by designing a family of Bayesian generative models. The proposed framework can be applied to problems in which the time-evolving distributions (of temporally localized data), rather than the samples themselves, are driven by a low-dimensional underlying process. We provide efficient parameter estimation and dimensionality reduction methodologies, and apply them to two applications: music analysis and epileptic-seizure prediction.},

	abstract = {Extensive data labeling on neurophysiological signals is often prohibitively expensive or impractical, as it may require particular infrastructure or domain expertise. To address the appetite for data of deep learning methods, we present for the first time a Fourier-based modeling framework for self-supervised pre-training of neurophysiology signals. The intuition behind our approach is simple: frequency and phase distribution of neurophysiology signals reveal the underlying neurophysiological activities of the brain and muscle. Our approach first randomly masks out a portion of the input signal and then predicts the missing information from either spatiotemporal or the Fourier domain. Pre-trained models can be potentially used for downstream tasks such as sleep stage classification using electroencephalogram (EEG) signals and gesture recognition using electromyography (EMG) signals. Unlike contrastive-based methods, which strongly rely on carefully hand-crafted augmentations and siamese structure, our approach works reasonably well with a simple transformer encoder with no augmentation requirements. By evaluating our method on several benchmark datasets, including both EEG and EMG, we show that our modeling approach improves downstream neurophysiological related tasks by a large margin.},

	abstract = {How do we compare between hypotheses that are entirely consistent with observations? The marginal likelihood (aka Bayesian evidence), which represents the probability of generating our observations from a prior, provides a distinctive approach to this foundational question, automatically encoding Occam's razor. Although it has been observed that the marginal likelihood can overfit and is sensitive to prior assumptions, its limitations for hyperparameter learning and discrete model comparison have not been thoroughly investigated. We first revisit the appealing properties of the marginal likelihood for learning constraints and hypothesis testing. We then highlight the conceptual and practical issues in using the marginal likelihood as a proxy for generalization. Namely, we show how marginal likelihood can be negatively correlated with generalization, with implications for neural architecture search, and can lead to both underfitting and overfitting in hyperparameter learning. We provide a partial remedy through a conditional marginal likelihood, which we show is more aligned with generalization, and practically valuable for large-scale hyperparameter learning, such as in deep kernel learning.},

	abstract = {Extending work of Rubin, this paper explores a Bayesian counterpart of the classical \$p\$-value, namely, a tail-area probability of a "test statistic" under a null hypothesis. The Bayesian formulation, using posterior predictive replications of the data, allows a "test statistic" to depend on both data and unknown (nuisance) parameters and thus permits a direct measure of the discrepancy between sample and population quantities. The tail-area probability for a "test statistic" is then found under the joint posterior distribution of replicate data and the (nuisance) parameters, both conditional on the null hypothesis. This posterior predictive \$p\$-value can also be viewed as the posterior mean of a classical \$p\$-value, averaging over the posterior distribution of (nuisance) parameters under the null hypothesis, and thus it provides one general method for dealing with nuisance parameters. Two classical examples, including the Behrens-Fisher problem, are used to illustrate the posterior predictive \$p\$-value and some of its interesting properties, which also reveal a new (Bayesian) interpretation for some classical \$p\$-values. An application to multiple-imputation inference is also presented. A frequency evaluation shows that, in general, if the replication is defined by new (nuisance) parameters and new data, then the Type I frequentist error of an \${\textbackslash}alpha\$-level posterior predictive test is often close to but less than \${\textbackslash}alpha\$ and will never exceed \$2{\textbackslash}alpha\$.},

Standard weighted least-squares fitting is only appropriate when there is a dimension along which the data points have negligible uncertainties, and another along which all the uncertainties can be described by Gaussians of known variance; these conditions are rarely met in practice. We consider cases of general, heterogeneous, and arbitrarily covariant two-dimensional uncertainties, and situations in which there are bad data (large outliers), unknown uncertainties, and unknown but expected intrinsic scatter in the linear relationship being fit. Above all we emphasize the importance of having a "generative model" for the data, even an approximate one. Once there is a generative model, the subsequent fitting is non-arbitrary because the model permits direct computation of the likelihood of the parameters or the posterior probability distribution. Construction of a posterior probability distribution is indispensible if there are "nuisance parameters" to marginalize away.},

We consider how to adapt techniques and architectures used for language modelling (LM), that appear capable of ingesting awesome amounts of data, towards the development of encephalography modelling (EM) with DNNs in the same vein. We specifically adapt an approach effectively used for automatic speech recognition, which similarly (to LMs) uses a self-supervised training objective to learn compressed representations of raw data signals. After adaptation to EEG, we find that a single pre-trained model is capable of modelling completely novel raw EEG sequences recorded with differing hardware, and different subjects performing different tasks. Furthermore, both the internal representations of this model and the entire architecture can be fine-tuned to a variety of downstream BCI and EEG classification tasks, outperforming prior work in more task-specific (sleep stage classification) self-supervision.},

	abstract = {Background
In cognitive neuroscience the potential of deep neural networks (DNNs) for solving complex classification tasks is yet to be fully exploited. The most limiting factor is that DNNs as notorious ‘black boxes’ do not provide insight into neurophysiological phenomena underlying a decision. Layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) has been introduced as a novel method to explain individual network decisions.
New method
We propose the application of DNNs with LRP for the first time for EEG data analysis. Through LRP the single-trial DNN decisions are transformed into heatmaps indicating each data point's relevance for the outcome of the decision.
Results
DNN achieves classification accuracies comparable to those of CSP-LDA. In subjects with low performance subject-to-subject transfer of trained DNNs can improve the results. The single-trial LRP heatmaps reveal neurophysiologically plausible patterns, resembling CSP-derived scalp maps. Critically, while CSP patterns represent class-wise aggregated information, LRP heatmaps pinpoint neural patterns to single time points in single trials.
Comparison with existing method(s)
We compare the classification performance of DNNs to that of linear CSP-LDA on two data sets related to motor-imaginary BCI.
Conclusion
We have demonstrated that DNN is a powerful non-linear tool for EEG analysis. With LRP a new quality of high-resolution assessment of neural activity can be reached. LRP is a potential remedy for the lack of interpretability of DNNs that has limited their utility in neuroscientific applications. The extreme specificity of the LRP-derived heatmaps opens up new avenues for investigating neural activity underlying complex perception or decision-related processes.},

Now, a burgeoning science of seizure timing is emerging, which in turn informs best forecasting strategies for upcoming clinical trials.

	doi = {10.1111/epi.16785},
	abstract = {Objective:
Most seizure forecasting algorithms have relied on features specific to electroencephalographic recordings. Environmental and physiological factors, such as weather and sleep, have long been suspected to affect brain activity and seizure occurrence but have not been fully explored as prior information for seizure forecasts in a patient-specific analysis. The study aimed to quantify whether sleep, weather, and temporal factors (time of day, day of week, and lunar phase) can provide predictive prior probabilities that may be used to improve seizure forecasts.

Methods:
This study performed post hoc analysis on data from eight patients with a total of 12.2 years of continuous intracranial electroencephalographic recordings (average = 1.5 years, range = 1.0–2.1 years), originally collected in a prospective trial. Patients also had sleep scoring and location-specific weather data. Histograms of future seizure likelihood were generated for each feature. The predictive utility of individual features was measured using a Bayesian approach to combine different features into an overall forecast of seizure likelihood. Performance of different feature combinations was compared using the area under the receiver operating curve. Performance evaluation was pseudoprospective.

Results:
For the eight patients studied, seizures could be predicted above chance accuracy using sleep (five patients), weather (two patients), and temporal features (six patients). Forecasts using combined features performed significantly better than chance in six patients. For four of these patients, combined forecasts outperformed any individual feature.

Significance:
Environmental and physiological data, including sleep, weather, and temporal features, provide significant predictive information on upcoming seizures. Although forecasts did not perform as well as algorithms that use invasive intracranial electroencephalography, the results were significantly above chance. Complementary signal features derived from an individual’s historic seizure records may provide useful prior information to augment traditional seizure detection or forecasting algorithms. Importantly, many predictive features used in this study can be measured noninvasively.},

We achieve this by interpreting the training and validation splits as draws from their respective `truncated' ground truth distributions, where examples in the validation set contain scores much larger than those in the training set. Model selection is performed on the validation set for some prescribed validation metric. A major research question however is in determining what validation metric correlates best with the expected value of generated candidates with respect to the ground truth oracle; work towards answering this question can translate to large economic gains since it is expensive to evaluate the ground truth oracle in the real world. We compare various validation metrics for generative adversarial networks using our framework. We also discuss limitations with our framework with respect to existing datasets and how progress can be made to mitigate them.},

It has been shown that the commonly used Cross Entropy (CE) loss is not robust to noisy labels. Whilst new loss functions have been designed, they are only partially robust. In this paper, we theoretically show by applying a simple normalization that: any loss can be made robust to noisy labels. However, in practice, simply being robust is not sufficient for a loss function to train accurate DNNs. By investigating several robust loss functions, we find that they suffer from a problem of underfitting. To address this, we propose a framework to build robust loss functions called Active Passive Loss (APL). APL combines two robust loss functions that mutually boost each other. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the family of new loss functions created by our APL framework can consistently outperform state-of-the-art methods by large margins, especially under large noise rates such as 60\% or 80\% incorrect labels.},

	abstract = {Variational autoencoders (VAE) are a powerful and widely-used class of models to learn complex data distributions in an unsupervised fashion. One important limitation of VAEs is the prior assumption that latent sample representations are independent and identically distributed. However, for many important datasets, such as time-series of images, this assumption is too strong: accounting for covariances between samples, such as those in time, can yield to a more appropriate model specification and improve performance in downstream tasks. In this work, we introduce a new model, the Gaussian Process (GP) Prior Variational Autoencoder (GPPVAE), to specifically address this issue. The GPPVAE aims to combine the power of VAEs with the ability to model correlations afforded by GP priors. To achieve efficient inference in this new class of models, we leverage structure in the covariance matrix, and introduce a new stochastic backpropagation strategy that allows for computing stochastic gradients in a distributed and low-memory fashion. We show that our method outperforms conditional VAEs (CVAEs) and an adaptation of standard VAEs in two image data applications.},

	abstract = {Electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring and objective seizure identification is an essential clinical investigation for some patients with epilepsy. Accurate annotation is done through a time-consuming process by EEG specialists. Computer-assisted systems for seizure detection currently lack extensive clinical utility due to the retrospective, patient-specific, and/or irreproducible studies that result in low sensitivity or high false positives in clinical tests. We aim to significantly reduce the time and resources on data annotation by demonstrating a continental generalization of seizure detection that balances sensitivity and specificity. This is a prospective inference test of artificial intelligence on nearly 14,590 hours of adult EEG data from patients with epilepsy between 2011 and 2019 in a hospital in Sydney, Australia. The inference set includes patients with different types and frequencies of seizures across a wide range of ages and EEG recording hours. Artificial intelligence (AI) is a convolutional long short-term memory network that is trained on a USA-based dataset. The Australian set is about 16 times larger than the US training dataset with very long interictal periods (between seizures), which is way more realistic than the training set and makes our false positives highly reliable. We validated our inference model in an AI-assisted mode with a human expert arbiter and a result review panel of expert neurologists and EEG specialists on 66 sessions to demonstrate achievement of the same performance with over an order-of-magnitude reduction in time. Our inference on 1006 EEG recording sessions on the Australian dataset achieved 76.68\% with nearly 56 [0, 115] false alarms per 24 hours on average, against legacy ground-truth annotations by human experts, conducted independently over nine years. Our pilot test of 66 sessions with a human arbiter, and reviewed ground truth by a panel of experts, confirmed an identical human performance of 92.19\% with an AI-assisted system, while the time requirements reduced significantly from 90 to 7.62 min on average. Accurate and objective seizure counting is an important factor in epilepsy. An AI-assisted system can help improve efficiency and accuracy alongside human experts, particularly in low and middle-income countries with limited expert human resources.},

	abstract = {Automated seizure detection from electroencephalography (EEG) would improve the quality of patient care while reducing medical costs, but achieving reliably high performance across patients has proven difficult. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) show promise in addressing this problem, but they are limited by a lack of large labeled training datasets. We propose using imperfect but plentiful archived annotations to train CNNs for automated, real-time EEG seizure detection across patients. While these weak annotations indicate possible seizures with precision scores as low as 0.37, they are commonly produced in large volumes within existing clinical workflows by a mixed group of technicians, fellows, students, and board-certified epileptologists. We find that CNNs trained using such weak annotations achieve Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC) values of 0.93 and 0.94 for pediatric and adult seizure onset detection, respectively. Compared to currently deployed clinical software, our model provides a 31\% increase (18 points) in F1-score for pediatric patients and a 17\% increase (11 points) for adult patients. These results demonstrate that weak annotations, which are sustainably collected via existing clinical workflows, can be leveraged to produce clinically useful seizure detection models.},
